Vera C. Rubin Observatory Documentation for Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2)¶
This site provides information about Rubin Observatory’s Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2),
simulated LSST-like data products containing extragalactic and galactic objects.
For general information about the Data Preview 0 (DP0) program, see dp0.lsst.io.
An LSST-like simulation of solar system objects is also available at dp0-3.lsst.io.
Term definitions are provided on the Rubin Observatory Glossary & Acronyms webpage.

Financial support for LSST comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through Cooperative Agreement No. 1258333, the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science under Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515, and private funding raised by the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded LSST Project Office for construction was established as an operating center under management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). The DOE-funded effort to build the LSST camera is managed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).
