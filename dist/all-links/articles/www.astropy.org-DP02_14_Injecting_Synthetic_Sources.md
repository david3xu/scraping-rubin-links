What's new in Astropy 6.1?
Install Astropy¶
There are a number of ways of installing the latest version of the astropy core package. If you normally use pip to install Python packages, you can do:
pip install astropy[recommended] --upgrade
If instead you normally use conda, you can do:
conda install -c conda-forge astropy
or using update instead of install if astropy is already installed.
The astropy core package is also available in a number of other package managers, so be sure to check your preferred one!
More detailed installation instructions (e.g., for building from source code locally) are in the documentation.

If you aren't sure if something is a bug or not, or if you don't have a Github account, feel free to ask on one of the forums.
