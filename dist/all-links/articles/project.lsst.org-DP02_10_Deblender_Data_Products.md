Deblending: Plans and Challenges

LSST will detect a multitude of galaxies out to 26th magnitude and beyond, producing unprecedentedly dense sky images for a survey of this type. To take complete advantage of this dataset we must be able to robustly infer single-galaxy properties from image regions in which multiple galaxies appear to significantly overlap. This introduces a challenging source of systematic uncertainty that affects object detection, shape measurements, and ultimately inference methods for cosmological parameters, such as dark energy, that depend on a maximally large sample of well-measured galaxies.
In this session we’ll discuss the challenges above along with strategies for deblending and deblended measurements, particularly in the context of dark energy science. We’ll review the current Project plans for detection and Scarlet deblending in the Data Releases, along with community-built tools for blending studies. It would also be good to hear any concrete plans from the wider community for implementing alternative deblending methods and for sharing the resulting data products. Anyone with questions, suggestions, or volunteer contributions touching on any of the above topics is encouraged to contact the session chair.

Financial support for Rubin Observatory comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through Cooperative Agreement No. 1258333, the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science under Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515, and private funding raised by the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded Rubin Observatory Project Office for construction was established as an operating center under management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA).  The DOE-funded effort to build the Rubin Observatory LSST Camera (LSSTCam) is managed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1950 to promote the progress of science. NSF supports basic research and people to create knowledge that transforms the future.NSF and DOE will continue to support Rubin Observatory in its Operations phase. They will also provide support for scientific research with LSST data.
