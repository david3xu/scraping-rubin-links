Abstract
Rubin Observatory will compute timeseries variability features on lightcurves to aid users in identifying objects of interest, both during realtime Alert Production as well as in the annual Data Releases. The Data Products Definition Document (DPDD; LSE-163) allocates space for pre-computed timeseries features, and a sample set is baselined in LDM-151. However, in the subsequent decade the scientfic community has made a great deal of further progress in this area. This technote reviews the relevant literature, grouping related features where possible; discusses potential concerns and open questions; and proposes a new baseline feature set.

Financial support for LSST comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through Cooperative Agreement No. 1258333, the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science under Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515, and private funding raised by the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded LSST Project Office for construction was established as an operating center under management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). The DOE-funded effort to build the LSST camera is managed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).
