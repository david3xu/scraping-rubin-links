New update on the website switch over
We have resolved the problems related to the SSL certificate. Now the website should be accessible from both minorplanetcenter.net and www.minorplanetcenter.net.
Reports of pointings and cometary activities are now available again.
MPChecker is working without any issues.
We will keep monitoring the website.
The Minor Planet Center (MPC) is the single worldwide
location for receipt and distribution of positional measurements
of minor planets, comets and outer irregular natural satellites of
the major planets.
The MPC is responsible for the identification,
designation and orbit computation for all of these objects.
This involves
maintaining the master files of observations and orbits, keeping
track of the discoverer of each object, and announcing discoveries to the
rest of the world via electronic circulars and an extensive website.
The MPC operates at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, under
the auspices of Division F of the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
All of the MPC's operating funds come from a NASA Near-Earth Object
Observations program grant. Much of the computer equipment that the MPC
uses was provided by the Tamkin Foundation.
