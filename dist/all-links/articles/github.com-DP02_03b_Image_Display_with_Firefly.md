DP0 delegates should please submit GitHub Issues to, for example, report bugs or persistent technical issues, request assistance from Rubin staff, and provide software-specific feedback about the Rubin Science Platform.
Instructions:
In the horizontal menu bar at the top of this page, click on the “Issues” option (with the circled dot icon).
Choose the green “New Issue” button at right.
Next to “Bug report” choose “Get started”.
Fill in the title and contents of your issue.
In the right side-menu, adjust the labels as appropriate, but leave the other options as they are.
Click “Submit new issue” when you’re ready.
Issues submitted here will all be addressed by Rubin staff.
Thank you very much for using GitHub issues! The feedback provided by delegates is an integral part of our DP0 goals.
For general questions about DP0 please visit http://community.lsst.org/, and make a new topic in the "Support -- Data Preview 0" category.
For DP0.2, see also the Troubleshooting Tips for the Notebook Aspect.
