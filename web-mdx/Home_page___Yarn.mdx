=====================================================================

Yarn is a package manager that doubles down as project manager. Whether you work on simple projects or industry monorepos, whether you're an open source developer or an enterprise user, Yarn has your back.

This documentation covers Yarn 4+. For the previous documentation dedicated to 3.6 and below, please refer to [v3.yarnpkg.com](https://v3.yarnpkg.com/).

### Workspaces

First package manager built specifically around workspaces, Yarn lets you split your project into sub-components.

### Stability

Yarn guarantees that installs that work today will keep working the same way in the future.

### Documentation

Special care is put into our documentation, which we keep improving at every new version.

### Plugins

Yarn may not solve all your problems - but it'll give you the tools to solve the ones you find on your way.

### Innovation

We believe in challenging the status quo. Yarn will always be at the frontline, brewing new workflows and improving old ones.

### Openness

Yarn is a fully independent open-source project tied to no company. Our contributor community defines the roadmap.
