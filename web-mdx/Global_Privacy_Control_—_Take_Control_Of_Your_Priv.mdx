Turn On GPC
-----------

Enable Global Privacy Control to communicate your privacy preference.

Send the Signal
---------------

Your browser will send the GPC signal to websites you visit.

Exercise Your Rights
--------------------

Participating websites can respect your privacy rights accordingly.

You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.

Now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (GPC), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).

Together, over a dozen organizations are developing the GPC specification. [Get Involved](#contact)

GPC lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
--------------------------------------------------------------

GPC is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.

The GPC signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per [CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315](https://www.oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/oal-sub-final-text-of-regs.pdf) for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the GPC signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers ([GDPR Articles 7 & 21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679)). Over time, the GPC signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.

> “40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.”

> “My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve \[the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act\] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.”

> “GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.”

> “It's past time to give consumers a real and enforceable way to stop companies from tracking and selling their data. My Mind Your Own Business Act would do just that, and this project \[Global Privacy Control\] shows it’s possible.”

**Ron Wyden**

_Senate Finance Chairman_

](https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1314234870747422720)

> “CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.”

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

[

### What is the Global Privacy Control (GPC)?

](#WhatIsGPC)

Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the specification.

[

### Who is supporting the development of GPC?

](#WhoIsGPC)

GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders: technologists, web publishers, technology companies, browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and civil rights organizations.

The GPC was initially spearheaded by [Ashkan Soltani](https://twitter.com/ashk4n) [Georgetown Law](https://www.georgetowntech.org/) and [Sebastian Zimmeck](https://twitter.com/SZimmeck) ([Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/)) in collaboration with [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/), [Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)](https://automattic.com/), [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), [DuckDuckGo](https://spreadprivacy.com/announcing-global-privacy-control/), [Brave](https://brave.com/global-privacy-control/), [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/), [Abine](https://joindeleteme.com/blog/how-to-enable-global-privacy-control/), [Digital Content Next (DCN)](https://digitalcontentnext.org/), [Consumer Reports](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/issue/tech-privacy/), and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/).

[

### I’m a policymaker. How can I support GPC or learn more about how it could apply in my jurisdiction?

](#Policymaker)

As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please contact us via email at [info\[at\]globalprivacycontrol.org](mailto:info%5Bat%5Dglobalprivacycontrol.org).

[

### How can I get involved in developing the proposed specification?

](#GetInvolved)

GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Privacy Community Group](https://privacycg.github.io/) (Privacy CG) in April 2020. A number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with the proposal [here](https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/10/).

Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see below).
