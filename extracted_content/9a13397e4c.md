# Virtual eventsÂ¶

All are welcome to attend any event or watch the recordings.

## Rubin Science AssembliesÂ¶

The weekly Rubin Science Assemblies are live virtual sessions that focus on learning to use the RSP.

**Connection info:** ls.st/dp0-events

**Dates and times:** Thursdays at 9am Pacific (1 hour)

Each assembly will start with announcements. On alternating weeks there will either be a presentation (usually a hands-on tutorial), or open drop-in time for Q&A with Rubin staff (like an office hour) and breakout rooms for co-working with other delegates.

For presentation weeks, all are welcome to volunteer to speak or to suggest topics they would like to see covered (contact Melissa Graham, mlg3k@uw.edu).

For open drop-in weeks, all are welcome to bring their questions or issues and get support from Rubin staff, or come with a topic of interest and co-work in a breakout room.

See all past DP0 Delegate Assembly Recordings.

## Rubin Data AcademyÂ¶

The annual Rubin Data Academy offers a one-week virtual program of hands-on learning, with time for networking and co-working. Students with no prior experience are especially welcome.

### 2024Â¶

Held virtually, June 17-18 & 20-21, 2024.

  * DP0 Rubin Data Academy 2024



### 2023Â¶

Held virtually June 12-16, 2023.

  * DP0 Virtual Summer School 2023



## Custom seminars (by request)Â¶

In addition to the virtual seminars and the publicly available recordings, requests for custom seminars are considered. These can be presentations or tutorials, and could be virtual or in-person.

Due to the limited resources, priority will be given to requests from scientists at small and underserved institutions (SUIs), primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), and minority-serving institutions (MSIs). Requests sent at least 6 weeks in advance are more likely to be accommodated.

**Example requests:**

  * Group âonboardingâ (account set ups, learning about Rubin in general, learning about specific resources) for, e.g., students at SUIs.

  * Invitations to provide virtual or in person tutorials related to DP0 at, e.g., a workshop.




To broaden the participation of the Rubin community in the activity, one or both of the following should be adopted.

  * The request should have a specific plan to include scientists and/or students at SUIs. For example, the activity could take place at a SUI or include funding access to the activity for scientists from SUIs.

  * The main activity (not including Q&A), should be recorded and made publicly available to be linked on this page. Alternatively, the recording can be shared to be posted by the Community Science Team.




Contact method: Contact Melissa Graham (mlg3k@uw.edu) or send a direct message to the Community Science Team via the Rubin Community Forum.

## DP0 kick-off info sessionsÂ¶

When DP0.2 and DP0.3 were released, kick-off info sessions were held to provide an overview of the available data products and how to access them via the RSP. New delegates are recommended to watch the recorded presentations and review the slide decks.

  * DP0.2 kick-off info session

  * DP0.3 kick-off info session.




## Past virtual event seriesÂ¶

### Stack ClubÂ¶

Stack Club was an open drop-in session for developing tutorials on the LSST Sciene Pipelines (colloquially called âthe Stackâ) for users, by users.

This activity still happens during the Rubin Science Assembly âdrop-inâ weeks, but the name âStack Clubâ has been retired.

### Third Thursday office hourÂ¶

These drop-in Q&A sessions were held on the third Thursday of every month at 04:00 and 14:00 UTC. These two time slots served the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) time zones, respectively.

Q&A with Rubin staff is available during every Rubin Science Assembly.

If the new time slot of 9am Thursdays (as opposed to 9am Fridays) is still insufficient for the global community and there are requests for a revival of the Third Thursday timeslots, it will be considered.
