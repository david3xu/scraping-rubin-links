# obs_lsst

A repository to hold the description for the LSST 3.2 GPix camera and other cameras which use LSST CCDs

This package includes metadata translator plugins for the `astro_metadata_translator` package. To see the translated header of a file use the `-p` option to register the plugins.

For example:
    
    
    $ translate_header.py -p lsst.obs.lsst.translators data/
    

will report translations of all the files in this repository.

## License

This package uses the GPLv3 license. The translator sub directory in `python/lsst/obs/lsst/translators` uses a BSD 3-clause license and is expected to be moved into `astro_metadata_translator` when the code stabilizes.
