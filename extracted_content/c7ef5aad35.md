## Easy publishing

Use industry and community-standard package managers with native tooling commands. Then authenticate and publish directly to GitHub.

## Trusted sources

Understand and safely install package contents. Get packages directly from the community on GitHub, and use only what’s been approved for your organization.

## Speed and security, native to GitHub

### Use the same secure login for your code and packages

Store your packages in the same secure environment as your source code, all protected by your GitHub credentials.

### Integrate packages with your workflows

With a full API and webhooks support, you can extend your workflows to work with GitHub Packages.

### Get fast and reliable downloads via a global CDN

GitHub Packages is built with the latest edge caching via a global CDN to deliver great performance, no matter where your builds run.

> “Packages gives us an automated and secure path to continuous integration and deployment, testing, and delivering products to our customers and users.
> 
> Shehzan Mohammed Director of Product Management, Cesium

> “As a Yarn maintainer I’m excited to see GitHub offer a new package registry solution, and I’m looking forward to leverage its capabilities in our future releases.
> 
> Maël Nison Yarn maintainer

> “Since GPR uses the same permissions and security as the rest of GitHub, we can spend less time managing multiple accounts, ACLs and on-premise infrastructure, and more time coding what matters!
> 
> Chief Information Security Officer Providence Health & Services
