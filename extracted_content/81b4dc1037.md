# Safir

Safir is Rubin Observatory's library for building FastAPI services for the Rubin Science Platform (Phalanx) and Roundtable Kubernetes clusters. Safir is developed, maintained, and field tested by the SQuaRE team.

Safir is available from PyPI:
    
    
    pip install safir

The best way to create a new FastAPI/Safir service is with the `fastapi_safir_app` template.

Read more about Safir at https://safir.lsst.io.

## Features

  * Set up an `httpx.AsyncClient` as part of the application start-up and shutdown lifecycle.
  * Set up structlog-based logging.
  * Middleware for attaching request context to the logger to include a request UUID, method, and route in all log messages.
  * Process `X-Forwarded-*` headers to determine the source IP and related information of the request.
  * Gather and structure standard metadata about your application.
  * Operate a distributed Redis job queue with arq using convenient clients, testing mocks, and a FastAPI dependency.
