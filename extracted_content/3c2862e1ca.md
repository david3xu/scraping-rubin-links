# Phalanx: Rubin Observatory Kubernetes Application ConfigurationsÂ¶

Phalanx [1] is a GitOps repository for Rubin Observatoryâs Kubernetes environments, notably including Rubin Science Platform deployments like https://data.lsst.cloud. Using Helm and Argo CD, Phalanx defines the configurations of applications in each environment.

This documentation is for Rubin team members that are developing applications and administering Kubernetes clusters. Astronomers and other end-users can visit the Rubin Documentation Portal to learn how to use Rubin Observatoryâs software, services, and datasets.

Phalanx is on GitHub at lsst-sqre/phalanx.

A phalanx is a SQuaRE deployment (Science Quality and Reliability Engineering, the team responsible for the Rubin Science Platform). Phalanx is how we ensure that all of our applications work together as a unit.
