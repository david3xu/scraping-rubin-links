# LSST Science Pipelines Documentation

**https://pipelines.lsst.io**

This repository, combined with content from the `doc/` directories of individual LSST Science Pipelines packages, is what you see at pipelines.lsst.io.

pipelines.lsst.io is automatically built by LSST's Jenkins CI for each `lsst_distrib` release (major, weekly, and daily releases):

  * The main site, https://pipelines.lsst.io, tracks the latest major release.
  * The latest weekly release is published at https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/weekly/
  * The latest daily release is published at https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/daily/
