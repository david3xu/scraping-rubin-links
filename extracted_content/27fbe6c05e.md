# Vera C. Rubin Observatory Documentation for Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2)

This site provides information about Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2), simulated LSST-like data products containing extragalactic and galactic objects.

For general information about the Data Preview 0 (DP0) program, see dp0.lsst.io.

An LSST-like simulation of solar system objects is also available at dp0-3.lsst.io.

Term definitions are provided on the Rubin Observatory Glossary & Acronyms webpage.

Important

To access the DP0 data sets see the getting started with DP0 checklist.

## Resources for DP0 delegates

The term delegate refers to the 900 data rights holders who have accounts in the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) and access to the DP0 data sets. Use the getting started with DP0 checklist to become a delegate and have access to the DP0 data sets.
