### About me

I am currently an Assistant Research Professor of Physics at Duke University and was previously an Associate Research Scholar at the Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University. I primarily work on the algorithms and software for the Science Pipelines of the Vera C. Rubin ObservatoryðŸ”­, formerly known as the LSST. My research interests are understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy, both at a fundamental level and from a cosmological perspective.

Most of my code are hosted in the LSST and LSSTDESC repositories on Github. But you can find my fun side projects among my Github repositories.
