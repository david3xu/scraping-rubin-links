## A shared vision of scientific discovery

LSST Discovery Alliance (LSST-DA) aims to maximize the impact of Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Targeted to begin in 2025, LSST will curate astronomical data at a scale never seen before, producing the ultimate map of our dynamic Universe. LSST-DA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that removes obstacles between Rubin LSST’s data-intensive output and discovery through bold programs that foster innovation, inclusion, and interdisciplinary collaboration. LSST-DA is an alliance of more than 30 institutions around the globe; We work closely with the Rubin Observatory team, and we are the only private organization focused on Rubin LSST science. Working together, we can propel a revolution in humankind’s understanding of the Universe while transforming the way we do science.
