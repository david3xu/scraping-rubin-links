# LSST the Docs: Keeper

**Keeper** is a web app for managing LSST software documenting published with the **LSST the Docs** (LTD) platform. You can learn more about LTD in our SQR-006 technote.

Keeper provides a RESTful API that is used by LTD Mason for publishing new documentation, and by the document web pages to help users discover and switch between versions of the docs. Keeper is implemented as a Python Flask app.

## Docs

**Read the docs athttps://ltd-keeper.lsst.io**.

The documentation covers both the REST API consumption and DevOps perspectives.
