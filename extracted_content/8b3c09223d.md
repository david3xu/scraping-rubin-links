# Phalanx

This is the Argo CD repository for the Rubin Science Platform. It stores the root Argo CD application, deployment configuration for the other applications, and a command-line tool to manage Phalanx environments.

See phalanx.lsst.io for full documentation.

Phalanx is developed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

A phalanx is a SQuaRE deployment (Science Quality and Reliability Engineering, the team responsible for the Rubin Science Platform). Phalanx is how we ensure that all of our services work together as a unit.
