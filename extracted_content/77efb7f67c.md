# Get the LSST Science Pipelines delivered to your computerï

Here you will find information on how to get a binary distribution of the LSST Science Pipelines of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory distributed to your personal computer, without building and installing the software yourself.

As a user of this software distribution service, both **stable and weekly releases** of the LSST software appear as if they were locally installed on your computer. Since **new releases just appear under local path** `/cvmfs/sw.lsst.eu` **without you to take any action** , you can focus on using the software, instead of on the technicalities of installing and updating it regularly.

Visit the Overview to get more details on the benefits and intended audience of this service brought to the LSST community by LSST-France and CNRS / IN2P3 computing center (CC-IN2P3).
