"### 3.1 Distribution of H and G12 parameters in observed filters\n",  
"\n",  
"This section explores the distribution of typical values of the `G12` slope parameter as a function of absolute magnitudes for Main Belt asteroids and Jupiter Trojans. Due to small phase angle coverage, nearly all of TNOs do not have measured phase curve parameters. Remember that the input (truth) `G` value using the `HG_model` that was used to generate the DP0.3 simulated object's observed properties was fixed across the population to a constant value of `G`=0.15. The DP0.3 automated phase curve fitting (which uses `HG12_model`) produces a nearly constant value for `G12` with a relatively small spread at bright magnitudes, and the scatter in measured `G12` starts to deviate more substantially at fainter magnitudes where its likely harder to recover the intrinsic value.\n",  
"**Notice:** warnings can be ignored, due to taking the log of the occasional negative or NaN value in the catalog, those points will not show in the plot."
