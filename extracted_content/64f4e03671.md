# qserv-operator

A qserv operator for Kubernetes based on operator-framework. An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes application.

## Continuous integration for master branch

Build Qserv-operator and run Qserv multi-node integration tests (using a fixed Qserv version)

Security overview

## How to publish a new release for the whole Qserv stack

### Qserv (and _worker, _master flavor containers), qserv_distrib, qserv_testdata

These are built and published by running the two jenkins jobs rebuild-publish-qserv-dev and build-dev, after pushing tags to all the involved repositories. Then release tags must be added to the resulting containers on docker hub.

### qserv-operator

Validate the integration of `qserv-operator` with the release in CI (i.e. GHA), using a dedicated branch
    
    
    cd <project_directory>
    # RELEASE format is "<YYYY>.<M>.<i>-rc<j>"
    RELEASE="2024.5.1-rc5"
    git checkout -b $RELEASE
    # Script below edit `qserv` image name in `manifests/image.yaml`, and prepare operatorHub packaging
    ./publish-release.sh "$RELEASE"
    

Then edit `qserv-ingest` version in `tests/e2e/integration.sh`, to validate the release component altogether. Once the release CI pass, merge the release branch to `main` branch.

In `main` branch, create the release tag and the image
    
    
    git tag -a "$RELEASE" -m "Version $RELEASE"
    git push --follow-tags
    
    ./push-image.sh
    

This will automatically push the release tag to the repositories, and push the tagged container images to docker hub.

## How to publish a new release to operatorHub

The above step (i.e. release publishing) must have been completed before doing this one.
    
    
    make bundle
    RELEASE="2024.5.1-rc5"
    OPERATOR_SRC_DIR="$PWD"
    # Clone community-operators and create a branch
    gh repo clone https://github.com/lsst/community-operators.git /tmp/community-operators
    cd /tmp/community-operators
    # Synchronize with upstream repository
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main
    git push origin main
    # Prepare a Pull-Request
    git checkout -b "$RELEASE"
    cp -r $OPERATOR_SRC_DIR/bundle /tmp/community-operators/operators/qserv-operator/"$RELEASE"
    # WARNING: Edit manually 'version' and 'replaceVersion' fields at the end of file qserv-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
    git add .
    git commit --signoff -m "Release $RELEASE for qserv-operator"
    git push --set-upstream origin "$RELEASE"
    gh repo view --web
    # Then make a PR: https://github.com/lsst/community-operators/compare
