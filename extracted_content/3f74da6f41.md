"By comparing Figure 1 and Figure 2, it is clear that the PSF size exhibits variations in both the `deepCoadds` (`Objects`) and in individual `calexps` (`Sources`). For the latter, the gradient observed is dominated by Kolmogorov turbulence, demonstrating the turbulent seeing variation across the focal plane. These variations are averaged down in the case of the `deepCoadds`, and therefore the correlation function decreases faster with distance. Both are in the `i` band in this case, and as a consequence, there are no chromatic variations in size coming from effects such as Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) or the seeing dependence with wavelength, which will be explored in the next section."
