# Service Abstraction Layer package

Provides tools to turn ts_xml interface description into C++, Java and LabView interfaces. Turns XMLs with the interface description into Avro schemas and language bindings. Without going into details, it can be said binding for the following primitives are generated:

  * **Telemetry** messages that a SAL component writes at regular intervals, e.g. to report data that varies continuously or slowly over time. Examples include measured temperatures and encoder readings.

  * **Events** messages that a SAL component writes when an event occurs, such as a change in discrete state. Examples include reporting a new commanded telescope target position, and reporting that the dome shutter is open, closed or moving. Log messages are also written as events.

  * **Commands** messages that a SAL component reads and acts on. Examples include command to start shutter opening.




LSE-70 provides more details, particularly starting at chapter 3.2.4.

# Installing on docker image

On lsstts/develop-env container, run the following:
    
    
    cd ts_sal
    setup -r .
    scons
    scons install declare

# Installing outside of the container

## Dependencies

  * **avro-src-1.11.1** for Avro to generate C++, Java and LabView interfaces
  * **libcurl4-openssl-devel
  * **libavro-devel
  * **libjansson-devel
  * **cmake
  * **g++
  * **maven-3.9.2
  * **libboost-devel
  * **libboost-filesystem-devel
  * **libboost-iostreams-devel
  * **libboost-program-options-devel
  * **libboost-system-devel



**The following works with Kafka compiled for AlmaLinux:8.**

On a almaLinux:8 docker image, run the following as root:
    
    
    yum -y update
    yum -y install git python3 which make java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

## Usage

To get needed github projects and setup environment variables, do:
    
    
    git clone https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_sal
    source ts_sal/setup.env

You will need then populate ts_sal/test directory with XML schema:
    
    
    git clone https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_xml
    cp ts_xml/python/lsst/ts/xml/data/sal_interfaces/*.xml ts_sal/test
    cp ts_xml/python/lsst/ts/xml/data/sal_interfaces/MTMount/*.xml ts_sal/test

### C++

For C++ development, install gcc-c++:
    
    
    yum install -y gcc-c++

To generate C++ interfaces for a SAL component (where `<component_name>` is the name of a SAL component, e.g. `MTMount`):
    
    
    cd ts_sal/test
    salgenerator <component_name> validate
    salgenerator <component_name> sal cpp

### Java

To generate Java libraries for a SAL component (where `<component_name>` is the name of a SAL component, e.g. `MTMount`):
    
    
    cd  ts_sal/test
    salgenerator <component_name> validate
    salgenerator <component_name> sal java
    salgenerator <component_name> maven

To run Java unit tests:
    
    
    salgenerator Test validate
    salgenerator Test sal java
    salgenerator Test maven
    salgenerator Script validate
    salgenerator Script sal java
    salgenerator Script maven
    cd ts_sal/java_tests
    mvn test

### LabView

To generate LabView libraries for a component (where `<component_name>` is the name of a SAL component, e.g. `MTMount`):
    
    
    cd  ts_sal/test
    salgenerator <component_name> validate
    salgenerator <component_name> sal cpp
    salgenerator <component_name> labview

Then run the LabVIEW GUI and import the `$SAL_WORK_DIR/MTMount/labview/SALLV_<component_name>.so` shared library

Then run the ts_SALLabVIEW VI to generate the .lvlib and VI's
