"This section compares the input phase curve parameters, `mpcH` and `mpcG`, that were used to simulate asteroids in DP0.3 with those derived using the `HG_model` in this tutorial to see how well the input parameters are recovered in the simulated LSST results at the end of the 10 year survey. The left panel shows the difference of 0.2 between the input slope `G` and the output slope `G` guided by the red solid lines in all four filters. The distributions of out-in absolute magnitude `H` are more complicated. Recall that `mpcH` is reported in $V$ band; the conversion from Rubin filters to $V$ is summarized in <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst/dp0-3_lsst_io/blob/main/data-products-dp0-3/data-simulation-dp0-3.rst\">Table 1 of the DP0.3 documentation</a>.
