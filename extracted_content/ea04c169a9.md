" 1\. HoloViews works with a wide range of plotting libraries, Bokeh, matplotlib, plotly, mpld3, pygal to name a few. You can change the HoloViews plotting library to be `matplotlib` instead of `bokeh` in Section 1 (e.g., `hv.extension('matplotlib')`; notice the holoviews + matplotlib icons displayed when the library is loaded successfully), and try running through Section 3 again. You will encounter some warnings about how certain options \"for Image type not valid for selected backend\", but you will also see the image display formats change to matplotlib. Try it, or try with some other plotting library. Don't forget to set the plotting library back to whichever you prefer to use for the rest of this tutorial.\n",
