Automate your workflow from idea to production

GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.

Learn more about getting started with Actions.

#### Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, and containers

Hosted runners for every major OS make it easy to build and test all your projects. Run directly on a VM or inside a container. Use your own VMs, in the cloud or on-prem, with self-hosted runners.

#### Matrix builds

Save time with matrix workflows that simultaneously test across multiple operating systems and versions of your runtime.

#### Any language

GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.

#### Live logs

See your workflow run in realtime with color and emoji. It’s one click to copy a link that highlights a specific line number to share a CI/CD failure.

#### Built-in secret store

Automate your software development practices with workflow files embracing the Git flow by codifying it in your repository.

#### Multi-container testing

Test your web service and its DB in your workflow by simply adding some `docker-compose` to your workflow file.
