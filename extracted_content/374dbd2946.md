## 1. Introduction

The Rubin Science Platform was designed to enable scientific analysis of the LSST data sets, which will be unprecedentedly large and complex. 
The software and techniques that are best suited for visualizing large data sets might be new to many astronomers.
This notebook introduces learners with some knowledge of python to three open-source Python libraries that enable powerful interactive visualization of catalogs.
 1. [**HoloViews**](http://holoviews.org): Produce high-quality interactive visualizations easily by annotating plots and images rather than using direct calls to a plotting library.
 2. [**Bokeh**](https://bokeh.org): A powerful data visualization library that provides interactive tools including brushing and linking between multiple plots.
 3. [**Datashader**](https://datashader.org): Accurately render very large datasets quickly and flexibly.

These packages are part of the [Holoviz](http://holoviz.org/) ecosystem of tools intended for visualization in a web browser and can be used to create quite sophisticated dashboard-like interactive displays and widgets. The goal of this tutorial is to provide an introduction and starting point from which to create more advanced, custom interactive visualizations. Holoviz has a [vibrant and active community](https://discourse.holoviz.org/) where you can ask questions and discuss visualizations with a global community. 

> **Notice:** If the notebook or any interactive features seem to stall, first try going a few cells back and rerunning them in order (the order in which cells are run is imporant for this notebook's functionality). If that does not work, try restarting the kernel. If issues persist, try logging out and restarting the Notebook aspect using a "large" instance of the JupyterLab environment.

> **Warning:** It is not recommended to "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells" in this notebook. Some of the examples require interaction (e.g., for the user to select points on a graph) in order to run correctly.

### 1.1. Package imports


```python
# General
import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Astropy
from astropy import units as u
from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
from astropy.units.quantity import Quantity

# LSST
from lsst.rsp import get_tap_service

# Bokeh
import bokeh
from bokeh.io import output_notebook, show, output_file, reset_output
from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, Range1d, HoverTool
from bokeh.models import CDSView, GroupFilter
from bokeh.plotting import figure, gridplot
from bokeh.transform import factor_cmap

# HoloViews
import holoviews as hv
from holoviews import streams, opts
from holoviews.operation.datashader import datashade, dynspread
from holoviews.plotting.util import process_cmap

# Datashader
import datashader as dsh
```

Show which versions of Bokeh, HoloViews, and Datashader we are working with.
This is important when referring to online documentation as APIs can change between versions.


```python
print("Bokeh version: " + bokeh.__version__)
print("HoloViews version: " + hv.__version__)
print("Datashader version: " + dsh.__version__)
```

### 1.2. Define functions and parameters

Update the maximum number of display rows for Pandas tables.


```python
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 5)
```

Set the HoloViews plotting library to be bokeh. 
You will see the HoloViews and Bokeh icons displayed when the library is loaded successfully.

Set to display output -- Bokeh plots -- inline in the notebook.


```python
hv.extension('bokeh')
output_notebook()
```

Note:  sometimes the `bokeh.io.show` function can be finicky when we switch output modes (e.g., from inline to an HTML file and back again); so we define the following two functions to avert a "Models must be owned by only a single document" error (see, e.g., <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/8579">https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/8579</a>).

These functions are used in Section 4.


```python
def show_bokeh_inline(p):
    try:
        reset_output()
        output_notebook()
        show(p)
    except:
        output_notebook()
        show(p)
```


```python
def show_bokeh_to_file(p, outputFile):
    try:
        reset_output()
        output_file(outputFile)
        show(p)
    except:
        output_file(outputFile)
        show(p)
```

## 2. Use the TAP service to obtain table data

The basis for any data visualization is the underlying data. In this tutorial we will work with tabular data.

We will execute a cone search about a defined coordinate with a specified radius using the Rubin TAP service.
For more details about using the TAP service and ADQL queries, please refer to the TAP queries notebook.

Get a Rubin TAP service instance.


```python
service = get_tap_service("tap")
assert service is not None
```

Define a reference position on the sky and a radius in degrees for a cone search


```python
coord = SkyCoord(ra=55.65*u.degree, dec=-40.*u.degree, frame='icrs')
radius = 1 * u.deg
```

Define the query pass to the TAP service.


```python
query = "SELECT coord_ra, coord_dec, objectId, r_extendedness, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(g_cModelFlux) AS mag_g_cModel, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_cModelFlux) AS mag_r_cModel, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(i_cModelFlux) AS mag_i_cModel "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec),"\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str(coord.ra.value) + ", " + str(coord.dec.value) + ", " \
        + str(radius.to(u.deg).value) + " )) = 1 " \
        "AND detect_isPrimary = 1 "\
        "AND scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_cModelFlux) < 27.0 "\
        "AND r_extendedness IS NOT NULL"
```


```python
print(query)
```

This query will return a very large dataset, so we will use an asynchronous query. This will take a few minutes.


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
```


```python
job.run()
```


```python
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```

After the job phase has completed, fetch the results into a Pandas table.


```python
data = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
```


```python
print(len(data))
```


```python
assert len(data) == 1345701
```

Compute three colors from the apparent magnitudes.


```python
data['gmi'] = data['mag_g_cModel'] - data['mag_i_cModel']
data['rmi'] = data['mag_r_cModel'] - data['mag_i_cModel']
data['gmr'] = data['mag_g_cModel'] - data['mag_r_cModel']
```

Use the r-band extendedness parameter to classify objects as having a "shape_type" of "point" or "extended".


```python
data['shape_type'] = data['r_extendedness'].map({0: 'point', 1: 'extended'})
```


```python
# Convert the objectId to a string because as an integer, it's too large for bokeh to handle:
data['objectId'] = np.array(data['objectId']).astype('str')
```


```python
# tx1 = np.where(data['shape_type'] == 'point')[0]
# tx2 = np.where(data['shape_type'] == 'extended')[0]
# print(len(tx1), len(tx2))
# del tx1, tx2
```


```python
assert data[data["shape_type"] == "point"].shape[0] == 232835
assert data[data["shape_type"] == "extended"].shape[0] == 1112866
```

## 3. HoloViews

[HoloViews](https://holoviews.org) supports easy analysis and visualization by annotating data rather than utilizing direct calls to plotting packages. For this tutorial, we will use [Bokeh](hrrps://bokeh.org) as the plotting library backend for HoloViews. HoloViews supports several plotting libraries and there is an exercise to the user at the end of this section to explore using HoloViews with other plotting packages. 

Create a 2% random subsample of this dataset with which to demonstrate some basic HoloViews functionality.


```python
frac = 0.02
data20K = data.sample(frac=frac, axis='index')
assert len(data20K) == round(frac * len(data))
```


```python
print(len(data20K))
```

### 3.1. Single plots

The basic core primitives of HoloViews are [Elements](http://holoviews.org/Reference_Manual/holoviews.element.html) (`hv.Element`). Elements are simple wrappers around your data that provide a semantically meaningful visual representation. An Element may be a set of Points, an Image, a Curve, a Histogram, etc. See the HoloViews [Reference Gallery](http://holoviews.org/reference/index.html) for all the various types of Elements that can be created with HoloViews. 

In this first example we will use the HoloViews [Scatter Element](http://holoviews.org/reference/elements/bokeh/Scatter.html) to quickly visualize the catalog data as a scatter plot. HoloViews maintains a strict separation between content and presentation. This separation is achieved by maintaining sets of keyword values as `options` that specify how `Elements` are to appear.  In this first example we will apply the default options and remove the toolbar.

Make a simple scatter plot of the data using the Scatter element.


```python
hv.Scatter(data20K).options(toolbar=None)
```

The `data20K` set contains many columns. If no columns are specified explicitly, the first 2 columns are taken for x and y respectively by the [Scatter Element](https://holoviews.org/reference/elements/bokeh/Scatter.html).

Now let's bin the data in RA using the robust [Freedman Diaconis Estimator](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.histogram_bin_edges.html#numpy.histogram_bin_edges) and plot
the resulting distribution using the HoloViews [Histogram Element](http://holoviews.org/reference/elements/bokeh/Histogram.html). 
We will also add in some basic plot options. Read more about about [customizing plots](https://holoviews.org/user_guide/Customizing_Plots.html) via `options`. Note that `options` can be shortened to `opts`.


```python
(ra_bin, count) = np.histogram(data20K['coord_ra'], bins='fd')
ra_distribution = hv.Histogram((ra_bin, count)).opts(
    title="RA distribution", color='darkmagenta',
    xlabel='RA', fontscale=1.2,
    height=400, width=400)
```


```python
ra_distribution
```

### 3.2. Layouts of unlinked plots

Next, let's create a layout of several plots. A `Layout` is a type of `Container` that can contain any HoloViews object. Other types of Containers that exist include `Overlay`, `Gridspace`, `Dynamicmap`, etc. See the HoloViews [Reference Gallery](http://holoviews.org/reference/index.html) for the full list of `Layouts` that can be created with HoloViews. See [Building Composite Objects](http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Building_Composite_Objects.html) for the full details about the ways Containers can be composed.

Slice the data and set some more options, and then construct a layout using the `+` operator.


```python
skyplot = hv.Scatter(data20K[["coord_ra", "coord_dec"]]).opts(
    title="Skyplot", toolbar='above', tools=['hover'],
    height=350, width=350, alpha=0.2, size=2)

skyplots = skyplot + ra_distribution.options(height=350, width=350)
```


```python
skyplots
```

Note that these two plots above are not linked, they are two independent plots laid out next to each other. Try zooming in on the skyplot, you will notice that the data are not rebinned in the RA distribution plot.  We will see how to link plots in Section 3. The tools however do apply to both plots. Try modifying both plots and then use the "reset" tool (the circular arrow symbol). Notice that both plots are reset to their original states. 

### 3.3. Layouts of linked plots

Next, let's set up some default plot options to avoid duplicating long lists everytime we want to make a plot. As different plotting packages typically provide different customization capabilities, we will define one set of options for a Bokeh backend and one for a matplotlib backend.

Set Bokeh customizations as a python dictionary.


```python
plot_style_bkh = dict(alpha=0.5, color='darkmagenta',
                      marker='triangle', size=3,
                      xticks=5, yticks=5,
                      height=400, width=400,
                      toolbar='above')
```

Set matplotlib customizations.


```python
plot_style_mpl = dict(alpha=0.2, color='c', marker='s',
                      fig_size=200, s=2,
                      fontsize=14, xticks=8, yticks=8)
```

Instead of subsetting a dataset to choose which columns to plot, HoloViews allows us to specify the dimensionality directly. 
`kdims` are the key dimensions or the independent variable(s) and `vdims` are the value dimensions or the dependenent variable(s). 

Choose to use the Bokeh plot style.


```python
plot_style = plot_style_bkh
```


```python
hv.Scatter(data20K,
           kdims=['gmi'], vdims=['mag_g_cModel']
           ).opts(invert_yaxis=True,
                  xlabel=" (g-i)", ylabel="g",
                  **plot_style)
```

The dimensions have be specified as strings above, but they are in fact rich objects. Dimension objects support a long descriptive label, which complements the short programmer-friendly name.

Let's look at a color-color diagram of the point-like sources in the dataset, and also display the distribution of samples along both value dimensions using the `hist()` method of the [Scatter Element](http://holoviews.org/reference/elements/bokeh/Scatter.html).

Set the axes as rich objects.


```python
rmi = hv.Dimension('rmi', label='(r-i)', range=(-0.8, 3.0))
gmr = hv.Dimension('gmr', label='(g-r)', range=(-0.8, 3.0))
```

Identify the point-like objects as "points" and create the scatter plot.


```python
points = data20K[data20K["shape_type"] == 'point']
col_col = hv.Scatter(points, kdims=gmr,
                     vdims=rmi).opts(**plot_style)
```

Use the hist method to show the distribution of samples along both value dimensions.


```python
col_col = col_col.hist(dimension=[gmr, rmi],
                       num_bins=100, adjoin=True)
```


```python
col_col
```

Try zooming in on regions of the plot. The histograms are automatically recomputed.  

### 3.4. Magics

The techniques to apply customizations in the cells above use standard Python syntax and are the recommended way to customize your visualizations in HoloViews. HoloViews also supports IPython magic commands. Magics are a much older approach that is not standard Python and is specific to notebooks. [HoloViews notebook magic](https://holoviews.org/user_guide/Notebook_Magics.html) supports both line and cell magics. Here is an example of using magics to plot the same spatial distribution of Objects as above.


```python
%%opts Scatter [tools=['hover'], toolbar='above',height=400, width=400](color='grey')
hv.Scatter(data20K).opts(alpha=0.3, size=3)
```

Our result set above contained a lot of columns for the hover tool to display. Often we want to be selective about which information we show in the hover tool and customize the names. We do this by creating a custom hover tool. 


```python
raDecHover = HoverTool(
    tooltips=[
        ('ra,dec', '@coord_ra / @coord_dec'),
        ('rmag', '@mag_r_cModel'),
        ('type', '@shape_type'),
    ],
    formatters={
        'ra/dec': 'printf',
        'rmag': 'numeral',
        'type': 'printf',
    },
    point_policy="follow_mouse"
)
```


```python
hv.Scatter(data20K).opts(tools=[raDecHover], **plot_style_bkh)
```

It might be necessary to zoom in until points are distinguishable in order to notice how the hover tool box contents list only three properties per point.

## 4. Bokeh

A very useful feature of Bokeh is the ability to add connected interactivity between plots that show different attributes of the same data: this is called **linking**. With linked plots, we can carry out data **brushing**, whereby we select and maniplulate data synchronously across multiple linked plots. For example, if we link a skyplot with a colour-magnitude diagram of the same dataset, we can interactively explore the relationship between the positions of objects in each plot.  

We will now look at the Bokeh plotting library directly to demonstrate how to set up brushing and linking between two panels showing different representations of the same dataset. A selection applied to either panel will highlight the selected points in the other panel.

This section is based on [Bokeh linked brushing](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/linking.html#linked-brushing).

### 4.1. Data preparation
Getting the data preparation phase right is key to creating powerful visualizations. 
Bokeh works with a ColumnDataSource (CDS).  A CDS is essentially a collection of sequences of data that have their own unique column name. We will create a CDS from the data returned by the query above and pass it directly to Bokeh. The CDS is the core of bokeh plots. Bokeh automatically creates a CDS from data passed as python lists or numpy arrays.  CDS are useful as they allow data to be shared between multiple plots and renderers, enabling brushing and linking.

Create a column data source for the plots to share. The data defined as x0,y0 and x1,y1 will be used to plot the left and right plots, respectively.


```python
col_data = dict(x0=data20K['coord_ra'] - coord.ra.value,
                y0=data20K['coord_dec'] - coord.dec.value,
                x1=data20K['gmi'],
                y1=data20K['mag_g_cModel'],
                ra=data20K['coord_ra'], dec=data20K['coord_dec'])
source = ColumnDataSource(data=col_data)
```

Additional data can be added to the CDS after creation.


```python
source.data['objectId'] = data20K['objectId']
source.data['rmi'] = data20K['rmi']
source.data['gmr'] = data20K['gmr']
source.data['mag_r_cModel'] = data20K['mag_r_cModel']
source.data['shape_type'] = data20K['shape_type']
source.data['r_extendedness'] = data20K['r_extendedness']
```

Create a "points" view on "shape_type" = point.


```python
points = CDSView()
points.filter = GroupFilter(column_name='shape_type', group="point")
```

### 4.2. Linked plots with data brushing

We will use Bokeh to plot a color-magnitude (g vs. g-i) diagram and a plot of the sky coordinates, and then link them.

Create a custom hover tool for each panel.


```python
hover_left = HoverTool(tooltips=[("ObjectId", "@objectId"),
                                 ("(ra,dec)", "(@ra, @dec)"),
                                 ("type", "@shape_type")
                                 ])
hover_right = HoverTool(tooltips=[("ObjectId", "@objectId"),
                                  ("(g-i,g)", "(@x1, @y1)"),
                                  ("extendedness", "@r_extendedness")
                                  ])
tools = "box_zoom,box_select,lasso_select,reset,help"
tools_left = [hover_left, tools]
tools_right = [hover_right, tools]
```

Create a new plot and add a renderer. Use the "points" view defined above.


```python
# Create the left-side plot
left = figure(tools=tools_left,
              width=400, height=400,
              title='Spatial: Centered on (RA, Dec) = (%.2f, %.2f)' %
              (coord.ra.value, coord.dec.value))
left.circle('x0', 'y0', hover_color='firebrick',
            size=3, alpha=0.7,
            source=source,
            view=points)

left.x_range = Range1d(1.5, -1.5)
left.y_range = Range1d(-1.5, 1.5)
left.xaxis.axis_label = 'Delta ra'
left.yaxis.axis_label = 'Delta dec'

# Create the right-side plot create
right = figure(tools=tools_right, width=400, height=400,
               title='CMD')
right.circle('x1', 'y1', hover_color='firebrick',
             size=4, alpha=0.8,
             source=source,
             view=points)

right.x_range = Range1d(-1.5, 2.8)
right.y_range = Range1d(32., 16.)
right.xaxis.axis_label = '(g-i)'
right.yaxis.axis_label = 'g'
```

Display the grid of plots. This can take a moment to render.


```python
p = gridplot([[left, right]])
show_bokeh_inline(p)
```

Use the hover tool to see information about individual data points (e.g., the "ObjectId"). This information should appear automatically as you hover the mouse over the data points. Notice the data points highlighted in red on one panel with the hover tool are also highlighted on the other panel.

Next, click on the selection box icon (with a "+" sign) or the selection lasso icon found in the upper right corner of the figure. Use the selection box and selection lasso to make various selections in either panel by clicking and dragging on either panel. The selected data points will be displayed in the other panel.

### 4.3. Output to interactive HTML file

Now, as we did in the DP0.2 tutorial notebook 06a on interactive image visualization, let's output this interactive plot to an interactive HTML file in your home directory.  Here, however, we will use the `bokeh.io.show` method, embedded in the `show_bokeh_to_file` function defined in Section 1.2 above, to perform the output.

First, let's construct the output file name:


```python
outputDir = os.path.expanduser('~')
outputFileName = 'nb06b_plot1.html'
outputFile = os.path.join(outputDir, outputFileName)

print('The full pathname of the interactive HTML file will be '+outputFile)
```

And now output the interactive HTML file:


```python
show_bokeh_to_file(p, outputFile)
```

As in the DP0.2 tutorial notebook 06a on interactive image visualization, to view the interactive HTML file navigate to it via the directory listing in the left-hand side panel of this Jupyter notebook graphical interface, and click on its name.  This will open another tab in which one can view the HTML file.  Since it is relatively small (about 3.6 MB), the file should load quickly (within a few seconds).  Once loading is complete, click on the "Trust HTML" button at the top-left of the tab's window.  You should see a near-duplicate of the two linked plots that we produced just above.

You can also download the file and interact with it by opening it in a browser on your local computer.

### 4.4. Linked streams

If we want to do subsequent calculations with the set of selected points, we can use HoloViews linked streams for custom interactivity. The following visualization is a modification of this example. As for the example above, in the plots generated below use the selection box and selection lasso to choose data points on the left panel. The selected points should appear in the right panel. Finally, notice that as you change the selection on the left panel, the mean x- and y-values for selected data points are shown in the title of the right panel.

This section is based on [HoloViews Selection1D points](http://holoviews.org/reference/streams/bokeh/Selection1D_points.html).

Declare some points, and define a selection for the stream.


```python
points = hv.Points((data20K['coord_ra'] - coord.ra.value,
                    data20K['coord_dec'] - coord.dec.value)
                   ).options(tools=['box_select', 'lasso_select'])

selection = streams.Selection1D(source=points)
```

Define a function that uses the selection indices to slice points and compute statistics.
This function is defined here (and not in Section 1.2) because it is only used in the following cell, for the plot below.


```python
def selected_info(index) -> str:
    selected = points.iloc[index]
    if index:
        label = 'Mean x, y: %.3f, %.3f' % tuple(selected.array().mean(axis=0))
    else:
        label = 'No selection'
    return selected.relabel(label).options(color='red')
```

Combine "points" and DynamicMap. Notice the syntax used here, how the "+" sign makes side-by-side panels.


```python
points + hv.DynamicMap(selected_info, streams=[selection])
```

In the next cell, we access the indices of the selected data points. We could use these indices to select a subset of the full sample for further examination.


```python
print(len(selection.index))
```

## 5.0  Datashader

The interactive features of Bokeh work well with datasets up to a few tens of thousands of data points. To efficiently explore larger datasets, we'd like to use another visualization model that offers better scalability, namely Datashader.

In the examples below, notice that as one zooms in on the datashaded two-dimensional histograms, the bin sizes are dynamically adjusted to show finer or coarser granularity in the distribution. This allows one to interactively explore large datasets without having to manually adjust the bin sizes while panning and zooming. Zoom in all the way and you can see individual points (i.e., bins contain either zero or one count). If you zoom in far enough, the individual points are represented by extremely small pixels in datashader that are difficult to see. A solution is to [dynspread](https://datashader.org/api.html#datashader.transfer_functions.dynspread) instead of datashade, which will preserve a finite size of the plotted points.

The next cell also uses the concept of linked Streams in HoloViews for custom interactivity, in this case to create a selection box. We'll use that selection box tool in the following cell.

### 5.1. Plotting thousands of data points

Plot a color-colour diagram using Bokeh with a customized hover tool


```python
plot_options = {'height': 400, 'width': 800,
                'tools': ['pan', 'box_zoom', 'box_select',
                          'wheel_zoom', 'reset', 'help']}

p = figure(title="Color-Color Diagram",
           x_axis_label="(g-r)", y_axis_label="(r-i)",
           x_range=(-2.0, 3.0), y_range=(-2.0, 3.0),
           **plot_options)
p.circle(x='gmr', y='rmi', source=source,
         size=2, alpha=0.2,
         hover_color='firebrick',
         legend_field="shape_type",
         color=factor_cmap('shape_type', 'Category10_3',
                           ['point', 'extended']))

hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[("objectId", "@objectId"),
                            ("(ra,dec)", "(@coord_ra, @coord_dec)"),
                            ("(g-r,r-i)", "(@gmr, @rmi)"),
                            ("type", "@shape_type")])
p.add_tools(hover)
```


```python
show_bokeh_inline(p)
```

We see that even with a medium sized dataset of ~20K points, this plot suffers from overplotting.  A classic strategy is to specify transparency of the glyphs so we can better see sparse and dense areas. In the plot above we have `alpha=0.2`. This helps,  but washes out the detail in the sparser regions. An additional problem is that we cannot add too many glyphs to any plot. 

HoloViews + Datashader allow us to plot millions to billions of points to produce much more informative plots. Datashader rasterizes or aggregates datasets into regular grids that can then be further analysed or viewed as plots or images.

Create a holoviews object "points" to hold and plot data.


```python
points = hv.Points((source.to_df()['gmr'],source.to_df()['rmi']))
```

Create the linked streams instance.


```python
boundsxy = (0, 0, 0, 0)
box = streams.BoundsXY(source=points, bounds=boundsxy)
bounds = hv.DynamicMap(lambda bounds: hv.Bounds(bounds), streams=[box])
```

Apply the datashader


```python
p = dynspread(datashade(points, cmap="Viridis"))
p = p.opts(width=800, height=300, padding=0.05, show_grid=True,
           xlim=(-2.0, 7.0), ylim=(-5.0, 3.0), xlabel="(g-r)", ylabel="(r-i)",
           tools=['box_select'])
```

Render the datashaded plot.


```python
p * bounds
```

This `datashade` plot of the same color-color diagram as above does not require any magic-number parameters such as size and alpha and automatically ensures that there is no saturation or overplotting.  Select the `wheel zoom` and adjust the image as you interact with the plot. Note how the shades of color of the data points change according to the local density.

### 5.2. Plotting millions of data points

In fact, this dataset is really too small to use datashader on. Let's see how to visualize the full >1 million object dataset returned by the query with datashader.

Create a Points Element for the data.


```python
points = hv.Points((data['gmr'], data['rmi']))
```

Create the linked streams instance.


```python
boundsxy = (0, 0, 0, 0)
box = streams.BoundsXY(source=points, bounds=boundsxy)
bounds = hv.DynamicMap(lambda bounds: hv.Bounds(bounds), streams=[box])
```

Apply the datashader.


```python
p = dynspread(datashade(points, cmap="Viridis"))
p = p.opts(width=800, height=300, padding=0.05, show_grid=True,
           xlim=(-2.0, 7.0), ylim=(-5.0, 3.0), xlabel="(g-r)", ylabel="(r-i)",
           tools=['box_select'])
```

Render the datashaded plot.


```python
p * bounds
```

### 5.3. Adding a callback function

Next we will add callback functionality to the color-color diagam above to retrieve the indices of selected points. We use the box selection tool to create a selection box for a two-dimensional histogram and then count the number of data points within the selection region.

> **STOP** - Select some data points from the plot above using the box select tool before proceeding


```python
selection = (points.data.x > box.bounds[0]) \
    & (points.data.y > box.bounds[1]) \
    & (points.data.x < box.bounds[2]) \
    & (points.data.y < box.bounds[3])
print('The selection box contains %i data points'%(np.sum(selection)))
```

### 5.4. Interactive selection

Now we will plot a spatial distribution on the sky of all the data (in the left-hand plot below), and link it to a two-dimensional histogram of the data (right-hand plot below). Use a box selection in the spatial distribution to change which data are included in the histogram.

First, create a holoviews dataset instance, and label some of the columns.


```python
kdims = [('coord_ra', 'RA(deg)'), ('coord_dec', 'dec(deg)')]
vdims = [('mag_r_cModel', 'r(mag)')]
ds = hv.Dataset(data, kdims, vdims)
```


```python
points = hv.Points(ds)
boundsxy = (np.min(ds.data['coord_ra']), np.min(ds.data['coord_dec']),
            np.max(ds.data['coord_ra']), np.max(ds.data['coord_dec']))
box = streams.BoundsXY(source=points, bounds=boundsxy)
box_plot = hv.DynamicMap(lambda bounds: hv.Bounds(bounds), streams=[box])
```

Create custom callback functionality to update the linked histogram.

These functions are defined here (and not in Section 1.2) because they are only used in the following cell, for the plot below.


```python
def log_inf(x) -> float:
    return np.log(x) if x > 0 else 0


def update_histogram(bounds=bounds) -> hv.Histogram:
    selection = (ds.data['coord_ra'] > bounds[0]) & \
                (ds.data['coord_dec'] > bounds[1]) & \
                (ds.data['coord_ra'] < bounds[2]) & \
                (ds.data['coord_dec'] < bounds[3])
    selected_mag = ds.data.loc[selection]['mag_r_cModel']
    frequencies, edges = np.histogram(selected_mag)
    hist = hv.Histogram(
        (list(map(log_inf, frequencies)), edges)).opts(xlabel='r (mag)')
    return hist
```


```python
dmap = hv.DynamicMap(
    update_histogram, streams=[box]).options(height=400, width=400)
datashade(points, cmap=process_cmap("Viridis", provider="bokeh")) * \
    box_plot.options(height=400, width=400, tools=['box_select']) + \
    dmap
```

Try changing the box selection and watch as the histogram is recomputed and displayed. 

Finally, delete the job


```python
job.delete()
```

## 6. Exercises for the learner

 1. HoloViews works with a wide range of plotting libraries, Bokeh, matplotlib, plotly, mpld3, pygal to name a few. As an exercise, try changing the HoloViews plotting library to be `matplotlib` instead of `bokeh` at the beginning of the notebook with `hv.extension('matplotlib')`. You will see the holoviews + matplotlib icons displayed when the library is loaded successfully. Recreate a few plots and compare the outputs. Try again with some other plotting library. Don't forget to set the plotting library back to whichever you prefer to use for the rest of this tutorial. Note that some warnings might be raised.
  
 2. Try writing a different callback function to use in Section 5.3. 
 
 3. As in Section 4.3, try writing other interactive plots from this notebook to an interactive HTML file. Which ones can easily be output to an interactive HTML file?  Which HTML files show full interactive functionality?  Which ones don't? 


```python

```
