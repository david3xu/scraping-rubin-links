# lsst.ts.simactuatorsÂ¶

Python actuator simulators intended for the simulations in Commandable SAL Components (CSCs).

## Using lsst.ts.simactuatorsÂ¶

The primary classes are:

  * `PointToPointActuator` simulates a simple actuator that moves to a give position at a constant speed, then stops. Examples include hexapod struts and telescope dome shutters.

  * `CircularPointToPointActuator` a point to point actuator that moves in a circle with no limits. Examples include some telescope dome azimuth actuators.

  * `TrackingActuator` simulates an actuator that slews to and tracks a path defined by a series of position, velocity, time triplets. Examples include telescope azimuth, altitude and rotator axes.

  * `CircularTrackingActuator` a tracking actuator that moves in a circle with no limits.

## Python API referenceÂ¶

### lsst.ts.simactuators PackageÂ¶

#### ClassesÂ¶

`BasePointToPointActuator`(start_position,Â speed)

Base class for point to point actuators that move to a specified position at constant velocity and halt.  
  
`CircularPointToPointActuator`(speed[,Â ...])

Simulated circular actuator that moves to a specified position at constant velocity and halts.  
  
`CircularTrackingActuator`(max_velocity,Â ...)

A version of a TrackingActuator that moves in a circle with no limits.  
  
`CosineGenerator`(center_positions,Â ...[,Â ...])  
  
`Direction`(value[,Â names,Â module,Â qualname,Â ...])

Direction of motion.  
  
`PointToPointActuator`(min_position,Â ...[,Â ...])

Simulated actuator that moves to a specified position at constant velocity and halts.  
  
`RampGenerator`(start_positions,Â ...[,Â ...])  
  
`TrackingActuator`(min_position,Â max_position,Â ...)

Simulate an actuator that slews to and tracks a path defined by regular calls to `set_target`.
