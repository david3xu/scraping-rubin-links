# ts_watcher

A CSC which monitors other SAL components and issues alarms for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory."

Documentation

The package is compatible with the eups package management system and `scons` build system. Assuming you have the basic Vera C. Rubin LSST DM stack installed you can do the following, from within the package directory:

  * `setup -r .` to setup the package and dependencies.
  * `scons` to build the package and run unit tests.
  * `scons install declare` to install the package and declare it to eups.
  * `package-docs build` to build the documentation. This requires `documenteer`; see building single package docs for installation instructions.



This code uses `pre-commit` to maintain `black` formatting and `flake8` compliance. To enable this:

  * Run `pre-commit install` once.
  * If directed, run `git config --unset-all core.hooksPath` once.
