# Kubernetes Community Operators

## About this repository

This repo is the canonical source for Kubernetes Operators that appear on OperatorHub.io.

## Documentation

Full documentation is generated via mkdoc and is located at https://k8s-operatorhub.github.io/community-operators/

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

**IMPORTANT** Kubernetes has been deprecating API(s) which will be removed and no longer available in `1.22` and in the Openshift version `4.9`. Note that your project will be unable to use them on `OCP 4.9/K8s 1.22` and then, it is strongly recommended to check Deprecated API Migration Guide from v1.22 and ensure that your projects have them migrated and are not using any deprecated API.
