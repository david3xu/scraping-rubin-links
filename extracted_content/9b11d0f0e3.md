# TunableLaserÂ¶

## OverviewÂ¶

Contact info

The Tunable Laser CSC is used to control an Ekspla NT-242 laser via the Rubin Observatory Control System. The laser is used to send light via a fiber to the Collimated Beam Projector and the Calibration Screen Illumination System, which is used to perform flat fielding. The CSC provides commands to change the wavelength, start and stop the propagation of the laser. It also provides the capability of selecting where the laser light is directed (CBP or Calibration Screen).
