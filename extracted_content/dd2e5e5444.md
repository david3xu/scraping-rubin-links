## TMA Documentation

### ts-tma

The vendor for the TMA is Tekniker. They will be providing PDF documents for operating the TMA. In an effort to have consistency across software documentation I will be transcribing the TMA documents onto this TMA Technote.

**Links:**

  * Publication URL: https://ts-tma.lsst.io
  * Alternative editions: https://ts-tma.lsst.io/v
  * GitHub repository: https://github.com/lsst-tstn/ts-tma
  * Build system: https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_tma/actions



### Build this technical note

You can clone this repository and build the technote locally with Sphinx:
    
    
    git clone https://github.com/lsst-tstn/ts-tma
    cd ts-tma
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    make html

Note

In a Conda environment, `pip install -r requirements.txt` doesn't work as expected. Instead, `pip` install the packages listed in `requirements.txt` individually.

The built technote is located at `_build/html/index.html`.

### Editing this technical note

You can edit the `index.rst` file, which is a reStructuredText document. The DM reStructuredText Style Guide is a good resource for how we write reStructuredText.

Remember that images and other types of assets should be stored in the `_static/` directory of this repository. See `_static/README.rst` for more information.

The published technote at https://ts-tma.lsst.io will be automatically rebuilt whenever you push your changes to the `master` branch on GitHub.

### Updating metadata

This technote's metadata is maintained in `metadata.yaml`. In this metadata you can edit the technote's title, authors, publication date, etc.. `metadata.yaml` is self-documenting with inline comments.

### Using the bibliographies

The bibliography files in `lsstbib/` are copies from lsst-texmf. You can update them to the current lsst-texmf versions with:
    
    
    make refresh-bib
    

Add new bibliography items to the `local.bib` file in the root directory (and later add them to lsst-texmf).
