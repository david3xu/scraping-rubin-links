# Jenkins Shared Library

This contains the shared libraries for the Telescope and Site Software Team's Jenkins instance.

According to the shared library documentation, pretty much any groovy object is allowed. However, the caveat here is that classes are not allowed to use the built-in DSL calls like `sh`. So we workaround it by making a file which defines functions and then at the end returning `this` which allows it to behave similar to a class without the object reflection. `Csc.groovy` contains a set of functions to help with the lifecycle for a CSC build. The `vars` folder contain the different types of **declarative** pipelines for the CSC lifecycle.

An example is below of what a `Jenkinsfile` can look like.
    
    
    @Library('SharedLibrary') _
    
    CondaPipeline(["ts_config_attcs"], "ts-athexapod", "lsst.ts.ATHexapod")
    
    

_Components_

Contains logic for abstracting tools used in building software.

_vars_

Contains logic for running different pipelines.

The hierarchy and patterns are taken from Chris Cooney's Repo. Also taken from gfkse's repo
