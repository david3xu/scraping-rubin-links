# The LSST Science PipelinesÂ¶

The LSST Science Pipelines are designed to enable optical and near-infrared astronomy in the âbig dataâ era. While they are being developed to process the data for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubinâs LSST), our command line and programming interfaces can be extended to address any optical or near-infrared dataset.

This documentation covers version **v27_0_0**. Learn whatâs new. You can also find documentation for other versions.

## Getting startedÂ¶

If youâre new to the LSST Science Pipelines, these step-by-step data processing tutorials will get you up and running.

Data processing tutorial series (these were developed using the `w_2021_33` version of the science pipelines):

  * Part 1 Data repositories

  * Part 2 Single frame processing

  * Part 3 Image and catalog display

  * Part 4 Global calibration

  * Part 5 Image coaddition

  * Part 6 Source measurement

  * Part 7 Multi-band catalog analysis.




Guide for processing DESC DC2 data in a shared repository using the Alert Production pipeline (this was developed using the `w_2021_30` version of the science pipelines):

  * Processing DESC DC2 data with the Alert Production pipeline.

## Citing and acknowledging the LSST Science PipelinesÂ¶

If you use the science pipelines in a published work, we request that you cite Bosch et al. 2018, 2019. In addition, it is appropriate to include an acknowledgement of the form:

> This paper makes use of LSST Science Pipelines software developed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We thank the Rubin Observatory for making their code available as free software at https://pipelines.lsst.io.

For studies that make use of the Data Butler and pipeline execution system, we request that you additionally cite Jenness et al. 2022. For studies that make use of the SCARLET source separation framework, we request that you additionally cite Melchior et al. 2018.

As the Rubin Observatory is not funded to provide support for the LSST Science Pipelines outside of the project, any support provided by project members will come out of their own free or science time. A fair way to acknowledge their help and good will may be to offer co-authorship on technical papers describing the derived software (e.g. pipelines).

Financial support for LSST comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through Cooperative Agreement No. 1258333, the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science under Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515, and private funding raised by the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded LSST Project Office for construction was established as an operating center under management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). The DOE-funded effort to build the LSST camera is managed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).
