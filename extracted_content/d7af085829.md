## Run a workflow  
on any GitHub event

Kick off workflows with GitHub events like push, issue creation, or a new release. Combine and configure actions for the services you use, built and maintained by the community.

Whether you want to build a container, deploy a web service, or automate welcoming new users to your open source projects—there's an action for that. Pair GitHub Packages with Actions to simplify package management, including version updates, fast distribution with our global CDN, and dependency resolution, using your existing GITHUB_TOKEN.

###  Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, and containers 

Hosted runners for every major OS make it easy to build and test all your projects. Run directly on a VM or inside a container. Use your own VMs, in the cloud or on-prem, with self-hosted runners. 

###  Matrix builds 

Save time with matrix workflows that simultaneously test across multiple operating systems and versions of your runtime. 

###  Any language 

GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.

## Community-powered workflows

GitHub Actions connects all of your tools to automate every step of your development workflow. Easily deploy to any cloud, create tickets in Jira, or publish a package to npm.

Want to venture off the beaten path? Use the millions of open source libraries available on GitHub to create your own actions. Write them in JavaScript or create a container action—both can interact with the full GitHub API and any other public API.

## What our community is saying

> “With the integration of Code References with GitHub Actions, developers can now easily locate feature flags in their code. Internally, we believe using Actions can optimize our CI infrastructure and streamline our build process by parallel testing our clients across Windows, Linux, and OSX.”
> 
> Edith Harbaugh CEO of LaunchDarkly

> “Our mission is to empower all development teams with Code Quality and Security tools. For SonarCloud that means detecting bugs and security vulnerabilities, all while contributing to simple yet powerful pipelines, where multiple tools can play together as a team. GitHub Actions allows just that!”
> 
> Olivier Gaudin SonarSource CEO & Co-Founder

> “The ability to automate our workflows, as well as simplify and manage our issues, code, packages, CI, and deployment solutions, all in one place is powerful. We're excited about publishing CI/CD workflows and to discover, reuse and contribute to the Actions ecosystem within Globant and the GitHub community.”
> 
> Ezequiel Pellettieri Unix and Database Services Tech Lead

> “Compared to other offerings, GitHub always has a head start and introduces bleeding edge features first. GitHub Actions, for example, is currently unparalleled by other vendors.”
> 
> Patrick Lühne Senior Software Engineer
