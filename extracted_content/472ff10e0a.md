# lsst-texmf: The LSST LaTeX classesÂ¶

The LSST lsst-texmf package contains LaTeX document classes, style files, and bibliographies that can be used to help you write LSST documentation in LaTeX to match the project style defined in [2] and [1], as documented in [3].

To get started, install lsst-texmf on your computer and check out the example projects. Next, learn more about writing documents with the `lsstdoc` class and making Beamer presentations with the `LSST-beamer` style file.

lsst-texmf is on GitHub at https://github.com/lsst/lsst-texmf.
