#### Abstract

The Rubin Observatory's Data Butler is designed to allow data file location and file formats to be abstracted away from the people writing the science pipeline algorithms. The Butler works in conjunction with the workflow graph builder to allow pipelines to be constructed from the algorithmic tasks. These pipelines can be executed at scale using object stores and multi-node clusters, or on a laptop using a local file system. The Butler and pipeline system are now in daily use during Rubin construction and early operations.
