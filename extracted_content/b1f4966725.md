# User guidesÂ¶

_User guides_ help users and team members understand and use your projects with conceptual documentation, how-to procedures, tutorials, and reference documentation. At Rubin Observatory, every software package, web service, and even data release has a corresponding user guide. Documenteer provides a configuration profile for creating branded user guides with Sphinx.
