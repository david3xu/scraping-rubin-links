# Get started with DP0Â¶

**DP0 delegates** are the scientists and students who have accounts in the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) at data.lsst.cloud and access to the Data Preview 0 (DP0) data sets.

Becoming a delegate and accessing the DP0 data is as easy as following the checklist below and getting an account in the Rubin Science Platform (RSP).

There is no application process. The only prerequisite is to be a Rubin data rights holder (see the Rubin Data Policy). The number of delegates is currently limited to 900. Space is available and all petitions are being accepted. If that changes this page will be updated.

## New delegate checklistÂ¶

Important

Rubin data rights are required in order to become a DP0 delegate and have an RSP account. Briefly, this includes students and scientists at US and Chilean institutions, and individuals whose name appears on the list of international data rights holders; find details in the Rubin Data Policy. If youâre not sure if you have Rubin data rights, please contact Heather Shaughnessy (sheather@slac.stanford.edu) before proceeding with these steps.

**Step 1.** Review the Participation guidelines.

**Step 2.** If you are sure you have Rubin data rights, submit a petition for an account in Rubin Science Platform (RSP) using the instructions on how to get an RSP account.

Everyone should use their full professional names and institutional email addresses. The process to verify data rights and approve petitions can take a few days. Please contact Melissa Graham at mlg3k@uw.edu or Heather Shaughnessy at sheather@slac.stanford.edu with any issues. Once your petition is approved and you can log in to data.lsst.cloud, you are a DP0 delegate.

**Step 3.** Get an account in the Rubin Community Forum and review how to get Support for DP0.

It is recommended to go to community.lsst.org/groups and join the âDP0 Delegatesâ group. DP0-related news and events are shared with this group. Opt-in to receiving email notifications from the Forum by setting the profile preference for âEmail me when I am sent a personal messageâ to âAlwaysâ. People new to the Rubin Community Forum might appreciate this video demonstrating how to navigate and post topics to the forum.

## Documentation and tutorialsÂ¶

All DP0 delegates are encouraged to use the documentation and tutorials to learn how to use the RSP to access and analyze LSST data, and to generate and test custom software to prepare for when _real commissioning data_ are released as Data Preview 1 (DP1) and DP2 (see the plans for early science with Rubin Observatory).

**Review documentation:** the data product definitions are available for the DP0.2 and DP0.3 releases.

**Work through tutorials:** follow step-by-step introductions to the Portal, Notebook, and Application Programming Interface (API) Aspects of the RSP, or the DP0.2 Tutorials and DP0.3 Tutorials.

**Attend live virtual tutorials:** the Rubin Science Assemblies take place every Thursday morning at 9am Pacific time, and feature announcements, tutorials, presentations, and time for Q&A or co-working. The Rubin Data Academy takes place every June and offers an intensive week of hands-on learning. Recordings are available for past seminars.

## Participate in DP0 activitiesÂ¶

### Inform improvements for the RSPÂ¶

**Participate in RSP usability testing.** Work through a few of these RSP Feedback Exercises, which range from beginner- to advanced-level and are designed to build new skills with the RSP. Then provide feedback to Rubin Observatory via a designated Feedback form.

**Participate in feedback surveys.** When requested, complete feedback surveys for Rubin Observatory.

Read the results from the DP0.1 survey or the DP0.2 survey.

**Reach out to the Rubin Users Committee.** The Rubin Users Committee is charged to take feedback from the community and advocate on behalf of all RSP users. The Users Committee can be contacted via email (RubinObs-Users-Committee@lists.lsst.org).

**Submit bug reports.** Help with RSP improvements by submitting bug reports via GitHub issues (see Technical assistance via GitHub issues).

**Suggest new features.** Help with RSP development by suggesting new RSP features via GitHub issues.

**Share your experiences.** Post about your DP0 investigations in the Data Preview 0 Community Forum category, so Rubin Observatory staff can see how users are doing science with the RSP.

### Extend the benefits of DP0 in the science communityÂ¶

**Join an LSST Science Collaboration.** There are eight LSST Science Collaborations, and new members are always welcome.

**Participate in the Rubin Community Forum.** Ask questions about DP0, or show-and-tell your DP0-related investigations in the Data Preview 0 Community Forum category. Respond to questions or discussion topics raised by other DP0 delegates. This helps to build a global self-supporting network of scientists engaged in LSST research.

**Participate in virtual events.** Attend DP0-related Virtual events. Ask questions and join the breakout discussions. All are welcome to present their DP0-related experiences (contact Melissa Graham).

**Contribute tutorials.** All delegates are welcome to share their own Jupyter Notebooks using the shared repositories delegate-contributions-dp02 or delegate-contributions-dp03. Tutorials for the Portal, API, or command-line can also be contributed to these repos.

**Share your DP0-related work outside of DP0.** For example, give a seminar about Rubin Observatory and DP0 at your home institution, give a tutorial about your RSP/DP0 experience in your Science Collaboration, or publish a paper on your DP0-related work.
