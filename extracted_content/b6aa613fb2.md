Incident with starting Action Workflows

**Resolved** \- On August 15, 2024, between 13:14 UTC and 13:43 UTC, the Actions service was degraded and resulted in failures to start new workflow runs for customers of github.com. On average, 10% of Actions workflow runs failed to start with the failure rate peaking at 15%. This was due to an infrastructure change that enabled a network proxy for requests between the Actions service and an internal API which caused requests to fail.  
  
We mitigated the incident by rolling back the change. We are working to improve our monitoring and deployment practices to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.   
Aug 15, 13:59 UTC 

**Update** \- Approximately 10-15% of customers may be experiencing problems executing new GitHub Actions runs. The problem is currently being investigated by our teams.   
Aug 15, 13:45 UTC 

**Investigating** \- We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions   
Aug 15, 13:35 UTC 

All GitHub services are experiencing significant disruptions

**Resolved** \- On August 14, 2024 between 23:02 UTC and 23:38 UTC, all GitHub services on GitHub.com were inaccessible for all users.  
  
This was due to a configuration change that impacted traffic routing within our database infrastructure, resulting in critical services unexpectedly losing database connectivity. There was no data loss or corruption during this incident.  
  
At 22:59 UTC an erroneous configuration change rolled out to all GitHub.com databases that impacted the ability of the database to respond to health check pings from the routing service. As a result, the routing service could not detect healthy databases to route application traffic to. This led to widespread impact on GitHub.com starting at 23:02 UTC.  
  
We mitigated the incident by reverting the change and confirming restored connectivity to our databases. At 23:38 UTC, traffic resumed and all services recovered to full health. Out of an abundance of caution, we continued to monitor before resolving the incident at 00:30 UTC on August 15th, 2024.  
  
To prevent recurrence we are implementing additional guardrails in our database change management process. We are also prioritizing several repair items such as faster rollback functionality and more resilience to dependency failures.  
  
Given the severity of this incident, follow-up items are the highest priority work for teams at this time.   
Aug 15, 00:30 UTC 

**Update** \- We have fully rolled-back the changes to database infrastructure and mitigated the impact. All services are now fully operational.

Disruption with some GitHub services

**Resolved** \- On August 13, 2024, between 13:00 UTC and 13:23 UTC the Copilot service and some parts of the GitHub UI were degraded. This impacted about 25% of GitHub.com users. This was due to a partial rollout of a caching layer for Copilot licensing checks. During the rollout, connections to the caching layer were overwhelmed causing the licensing checks to timeout. Many pages were impacted by this failure due to a lack of resiliency to the timeouts.  
  
We mitigated the incident by reverting the rollout of the caching layer 11 minutes after initial detection. This immediately restored functionality for affected users.  
  
We are working to gracefully degrade experiences during these types of failures and reduce dependencies across services that may cause these types of failures in the future.  
  
Aug 13, 13:23 UTC 

**Update** \- Pull Requests is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.   
Aug 13, 13:16 UTC 

**Investigating** \- We are currently investigating this issue.

Incident with Webhooks

**Resolved** \- On August 12, 2024 from 13:39 to 14:28 UTC some users experienced an elevated rate of errors of up to 0.45% from the GitHub API. Less than 5% of webhooks interactions failed and less than 0.5% of Actions runs were delayed.  
  
This impact was caused by internal networking instances being insufficiently scaled.  
  
We mitigated the incident by provisioning additional instances. We are working to enhance the sizing strategy for the relevant infrastructure to prevent similar issues and to also improve monitoring and processes to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.   
Aug 12, 14:41 UTC 

**Update** \- Webhooks is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.   
Aug 12, 14:41 UTC 

**Update** \- Webhooks is operating normally.   
Aug 12, 14:41 UTC 

**Update** \- Some customers may see failures calling the webhooks API or running queries for enterprise or organization audit logs. We have started mitigating the issue and are watching recovery. We will provide an update within the next 30 minutes.   
Aug 12, 14:32 UTC 

**Investigating** \- We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Webhooks

[Retroactive] Incident with Pull Requests

**Resolved** \- Beginning at 6:52 PM UTC on August 6, 2024 and lasting until 6:59 PM UTC, some customers of github.com saw errors when navigating to a Pull Request. The error rate peaked at ~5% for logged in users. This was due to a change which was rolled back after alerts fired during the deployment.  
  
We did not status before we completed the rollback, and the incident is currently resolved. We are sorry for the delayed post on githubstatus.com.
