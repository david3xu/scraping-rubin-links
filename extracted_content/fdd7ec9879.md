# Kafkit#

Kafkit helps you write Kafka producers and consumers in Python with asyncio:

  * Kafkit provides a client for the Confluent Schema Registryâs HTTP API. The `RegistryApi` client includes both high-level methods for managing subjects and schemas in a Registry, and direct low-level access to HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE). The high-level methods use caching so you can use the client as an integral part of your applicationâs schema management. The client is implemented for both aiohttp and httpx, but since the base class is designed with a sans IO architecture, a Registry client can be implemented with any asyncio HTTP library.

  * Kafkit provides Avro message serializers and deserializers that integrate with the Confluent Schema Registry: `Deserializer`, `Serializer`, and `PolySerializer`.

  * The `RecordNameSchemaManager` is a streamlined tool for serializing messages using the schemas maintained by your app, while also integrating with the Confluent Schema Registry.

  * The `kafkit.ssl` module helps you connect to SSL-secured Kafka brokers.




## Installation#

Kafkit can be installed with different HTTP clients for convenience

httpx
    
    
    pip install kafkit[httpx]
    

aiohttp
    
    
    pip install kafkit[aiohttp]
    

No client
    
    
    pip install kafkit
    

Kafkit is also available on Conda-Forge at conda-forge/kafkit-feedstock.
