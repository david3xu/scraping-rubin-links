"Clearly it's not just a uniform \"belt\" between Mars and Jupiter -- it has some \"gaps\" where there are very few (or no) objects. These are known as [Kirkwood gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_gap), which arise due to resonances between the asteroid's orbital period and that of Jupiter. For example, at a=2.5 au, an asteroid orbits 3 times for each single orbit of Jupiter, and is thus in a \"3:1 resonance\".
