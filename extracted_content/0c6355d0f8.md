# About the technical documentation portal

## Purpose

The goal of this documentation portal is to help you access and discover the Rubin Observatory’s public technical documentation. This portal is available to everyone: the observatory team, the astronomy community, and the general public.

Although there may be some public technical documentation that is not yet available through this search portal, we index all our technote document series, and are adding new sources all the time. See the content coverage table, below for details.

_Documentation that isn’t public is beyond the scope of this portal._ Observatory team members should log into individual platforms to find non-public information, such as DocuShare, Jira, Confluence, or the Project homepage.

## Content coverage

Content types are added systematically as we develop our content indexer, Ook. The following table summarizes the types of content that are currently available through the portal, along with content types that we anticipate adding in the future.

Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a Federal project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science, with early construction funding received from private donations through the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded LSST (now Rubin Observatory) Project Office for construction was established as an operating center under the management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). The DOE-funded effort to build the Rubin Observatory LSST Camera (LSSTCam) is managed by SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).

NSF and DOE will continue to support Rubin Observatory in its operations phase to carry out the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. They will also provide support for scientific research with the data. During operations, NSF funding is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with NSF, and DOE funding is managed by SLAC under contract by DOE. Rubin Observatory is operated by NSF's NOIRLab and SLAC.
