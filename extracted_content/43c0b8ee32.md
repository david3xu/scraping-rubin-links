# ts_observatory_control

Documentation

Observatory control software. The repo defines the RemoteGroup class which represent a group of components () in the control system. This class implements basic functionality that is common to all groups of CSCs. In addition, this repository provides high-level control algorithm in the form of specialized groups of CSCs, like ATCS, which implements high-level operation on a specific group of CSCs.

Examples of high-level operation is to slew the telescope to a named target and wait until all the principal components are in position (Telescope, Dome, etc).

This code is automatically formatted by black using a git pre-commit hook. To enable this:

Install the black Python package with

`` pip install black ``

Run git config core.hooksPath .githooks once in this repository.
