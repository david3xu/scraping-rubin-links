> “\[Algolia\] was very professional from the start. We had a great Customer Success Manager and team that provided a lot of help and was a great partner.”

Clint Fischerström

Head of Ecommerce @ Swedol

> “I think we’ve grown leaps and bounds with Algolia. There's a lot of features that we still can tap into, which is great because I feel like we've gotten a ton out of it already.”

Geoff Lyman

Digital Experience Solutions Manager @ Hershey's

> “Instead of having to go into the back end and the catalog—which would have been a technical headache—we were able to figure it out in a matter of a day, test it, and ‘boom’ it’s live.”

Courtney Grisham

Director of E-Commerce @ Shoe Carnival

> “Algolia is very fast — able to keep up with our level of traffic… The API and SDK options are really great, and the ability to handle traffic at scale (we have a high volume)”

Matt Goorley

Engineering Manager @ LTK

> “Algolia is a breeze to work with. With Algolia, our editorial team has seen significant productivity improvements when building the daily online edition of The Times and weekly edition of The Sunday Times, with search being 300-500 times faster than our prior solution.”
