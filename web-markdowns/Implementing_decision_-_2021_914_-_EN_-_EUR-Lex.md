COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2021/914

of 4 June 2021

on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) [(1)](#ntr1-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0001), and in particular Article 28(7) and Article 46(2)(c) thereof,

Whereas:

 

(1)

Technological developments are facilitating cross-border data flows necessary for the expansion of international cooperation and international trade. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is not undermined where personal data is transferred to third countries, including in cases of onward transfers [(2)](#ntr2-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0002). The data transfer provisions in Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are intended to ensure the continuity of that high level of protection where personal data is transferred to a third country [(3)](#ntr3-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0003).

 

(2)

Pursuant to Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in the absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission pursuant to Article 45(3), a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country only if it has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. Such safeguards may be provided for by standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission pursuant to Article 46(2)(c).

 

(3)

The role of standard contractual clauses is limited to ensuring appropriate data protection safeguards for international data transfers. Therefore, the controller or processor transferring the personal data to a third country (the ‘data exporter’) and the controller or processor receiving the personal data (the ‘data importer’) are free to include those standard contractual clauses in a wider contract and to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects. Controllers and processors are encouraged to provide additional safeguards by means of contractual commitments that supplement the standard contractual clauses [(4)](#ntr4-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0004). The use of the standard contractual clauses is without prejudice to any contractual obligations of the data exporter and/or importer to ensure respect for applicable privileges and immunities.

 

(4)

Beyond using standard contractual clauses to provide appropriate safeguards for transfers pursuant to Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the data exporter has to fulfil its general responsibilities as controller or processor under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Those responsibilities include an obligation of the controller to provide data subjects with information about the fact that it intends to transfer their personal data to a third country pursuant to Article 13(1)(f) and Article 14(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In the case of transfers pursuant to Article 46 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, such information must include a reference to the appropriate safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or information where they have been made available.

 

(5)

Commission Decisions 2001/497/EC [(5)](#ntr5-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0005) and 2010/87/EU [(6)](#ntr6-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0006) contain standard contractual clauses to facilitate the transfer of personal data from a data controller established in the Union to a controller or processor established in a third country that does not offer an adequate level of protection. Those decisions were based on Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [(7)](#ntr7-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0007).

 

(6)

Pursuant to Article 46(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Decision 2001/497/EC and Decision 2010/87/EU remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by a Commission decision adopted pursuant to Article 46(2) of that Regulation. The standard contractual clauses in the decisions required updating in the light of new requirements in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Moreover, since the decisions were adopted, the digital economy has seen significant developments, with the widespread use of new and more complex processing operations often involving multiple data importers and exporters, long and complex processing chains, and evolving business relationships. This calls for modernisation of the standard contractual clauses to reflect those realities better, by covering additional processing and transfer situations, and to allow a more flexible approach, for example with respect to the number of parties able to join the contract.

 

(7)

A controller or processor may use the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision to provide appropriate safeguards within the meaning of Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for the transfer of personal data to a processor or controller established in a third country, without prejudice to the interpretation of the notion of international transfer in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The standard contractual clauses may be used for such transfers only to the extent that the processing by the importer does not fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. This also includes the transfer of personal data by a controller or processor not established in the Union, to the extent that the processing is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (pursuant to Article 3(2) thereof), because it relates to the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the Union or the monitoring of their behaviour as far as it takes place within the Union.

 

(8)

Given the general alignment of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [(8)](#ntr8-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0008), it should be possible to use the standard contractual clauses also in the context of a contract, as referred to in Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 for the transfer of personal data to a sub-processor in a third country by a processor that is not a Union institution or body, but which is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and which processes personal data on behalf of a Union institution or body in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. Provided the contract reflects the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 29(3) Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in particular by providing sufficient guarantees for technical and organisational measures to ensure that the processing meets the requirements of that Regulation, this will ensure compliance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. In particular, that will be the case where the controller and processor use the standard contractual clauses in Commission Implementing Decision on standard contractual clauses between controllers and processors under Article 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Article 29(7) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [(9)](#ntr9-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0009).

 

(9)

Where the processing involves data transfers from controllers subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to processors outside its territorial scope or from processors subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to sub-processors outside its territorial scope, the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision should also allow to fulfil the requirements of Article 28(3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

 

(10)

The standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision combine general clauses with a modular approach to cater for various transfer scenarios and the complexity of modern processing chains. In addition to the general clauses, controllers and processors should select the module applicable to their situation, so as to tailor their obligations under the standard contractual clauses to their role and responsibilities in relation to the data processing in question. It should be possible for more than two parties to adhere to the standard contractual clauses. Moreover, additional controllers and processors should be allowed to accede to the standard contractual clauses as data exporters or importers throughout the lifecycle of the contract of which they form a part.

 

(11)

In order to provide appropriate safeguards, the standard contractual clauses should ensure that the personal data transferred on that basis is afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the Union [(10)](#ntr10-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0010). With a view to ensuring transparency of processing, data subjects should be provided with a copy of the standard contractual clauses and be informed, in particular, of the categories of personal data processed, the right to obtain a copy of the standard contractual clauses, and any onward transfer. Onward transfers by the data importer to a third party in another third country should be allowed only if the third party accedes to the standard contractual clauses, if the continuity of protection is ensured otherwise, or in specific situations, such as on the basis of the explicit, informed consent of the data subject.

 

(12)

With some exceptions, in particular as regards certain obligations that exclusively concern the relationship between the data exporter and data importer, data subjects should be able to invoke, and where necessary enforce, the standard contractual clauses as third-party beneficiaries. Therefore, while the parties should be allowed to choose the law of one of the Member States as governing the standard contractual clauses, that law must allow for third-party beneficiary rights. In order to facilitate individual redress, the standard contractual clauses should require the data importer to inform data subjects of a contact point and to deal promptly with any complaints or requests. In the event of a dispute between the data importer and a data subject who invokes his or her rights as a third-party beneficiary, the data subject should be able to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority or refer the dispute to the competent courts in the EU.

 

(13)

In order to ensure effective enforcement, the data importer should be required to submit to the jurisdiction of such authority and courts, and to commit to abide by any binding decision under the applicable Member State law. In particular, the data importer should agree to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. In addition, the data importer should have the option of offering data subjects the opportunity to seek redress before an independent dispute resolution body, at no cost. In line with Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data subjects should be allowed to be represented by associations or other bodies in disputes against the data importer if they so wish.

 

(14)

The standard contractual clauses should provide for rules on liability between the parties and with respect to data subjects, and rules on indemnification between the parties. Where the data subject suffers material or non-material damage as a consequence of any breach of the third-party beneficiary rights under the standard contractual clauses, he or she should be entitled to compensation. This should be without prejudice to any liability under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

 

(15)

In the case of a transfer to a data importer acting as a processor or sub-processor, specific requirements should apply in accordance with Article 28(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The standard contractual clauses should require the data importer to make available all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in the clauses and to allow for and contribute to audits of its processing activities by the data exporter. With respect to the engagement of any sub-processor by the data importer, in line with Article 28(2) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the standard contractual clauses should in particular set out the procedure for general or specific authorisation from the data exporter and the requirement for a written contract with the sub-processor ensuring the same level of protection as under the clauses.

 

(16)

It is appropriate to provide different safeguards in the standard contractual clauses that cover the specific situation of a transfer of personal data by a processor in the Union to its controller in a third country and reflect the limited self-standing obligations for processors under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In particular, the standard contractual clauses should require the processor to inform the controller if it is unable to follow its instructions, including if such instructions infringe Union data protection law, and require the controller to refrain from any actions that would prevent the processor from fulfilling its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. They should also require the parties to assist each other in responding to enquiries and requests from data subjects under the local law applicable to the data importer or, for data processing in the Union, under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Additional requirements to address any effects of the laws of the third country of destination on the controller’s compliance with the clauses, in particular how to deal with binding requests from public authorities in the third country for disclosure of the transferred personal data, should apply where the Union processor combines the personal data received from the controller in the third country with personal data collected by the processor in the Union. Conversely, no such requirements are justified where the outsourcing merely involves the processing and transfer back of personal data that has been received from the controller and in any event has been and will remain subject to the jurisdiction of the third country in question.

 

(17)

The parties should be able to demonstrate compliance with the standard contractual clauses. In particular, the data importer should be required to keep appropriate documentation for the processing activities under its responsibility and to inform the data exporter promptly if it is unable to comply with the clauses, for whatever reason. In turn, the data exporter should suspend the transfer and, in particularly serious cases, have the right to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under standard contractual clauses, where the data importer is in breach of the clauses or unable to comply with them. Specific rules should apply where local laws affect compliance with the clauses. Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract, and any copies thereof, should at the choice of the data exporter be returned to the data exporter or destroyed in their entirety.

 

(18)

The standard contractual clauses should provide for specific safeguards, in particular in the light of the case law of the Court of Justice [(11)](#ntr11-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0011), to address any effects of the laws of the third country of destination on the data importer’s compliance with the clauses, in particular how to deal with binding requests from public authorities in that country for disclosure of the transferred personal data.

 

(19)

The transfer and processing of personal data under standard contractual clauses should not take place if the laws and practices of the third country of destination prevent the data importer from complying with the clauses. In this context, laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should not be considered as being in conflict with the standard contractual clauses. The parties should warrant that, at the time of agreeing to the standard contractual clauses, they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices applicable to the data importer are not in line with these requirements.

 

(20)

The parties should take account, in particular, of the specific circumstances of the transfer (such as the content and duration of the contract, the nature of the data to be transferred, the type of recipient, the purpose of the processing), the laws and practices of the third country of destination that are relevant in light of the circumstances of the transfer and any safeguards put in place to supplement those under the standard contractual clauses (including relevant contractual, technical and organisational measures applying to the transmission of personal data and its processing in the country of destination). As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with the standard contractual clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment, including reliable information on the application of the law in practice (such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies), the existence or absence of requests in the same sector and, under strict conditions, the documented practical experience of the data exporter and/or data importer.

 

(21)

The data importer should notify the data exporter if, after agreeing to the standard contractual clauses, it has reason to believe that it is not able to comply with the standard contractual clauses. If the data exporter receives such notification or otherwise becomes aware that the data importer is no longer able to comply with the standard contractual clauses, it should identify appropriate measures to address the situation, if necessary in consultation with the competent supervisory authority. Such measures may include supplementary measures adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer, such as technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality. The data exporter should be required to suspend the transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards can be ensured, or if so instructed by the competent supervisory authority.

 

(22)

Where possible, the data importer should notify the data exporter and the data subject if it receives a legally binding request from a public (including judicial) authority under the law of the country of destination for disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to the standard contractual clauses. Similarly, it should notify them if it becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to such personal data, in accordance with the law of the third country of destination. If, despite its best efforts, the data importer is not in a position to notify the data exporter and/or the data subject of specific disclosure requests, it should provide the data exporter with as much relevant information as possible on the requests. In addition, the data importer should provide the data exporter with aggregate information at regular intervals. The data importer should also be required to document any request for disclosure received and the response provided, and make that information available to the data exporter or the competent supervisory authority, or both, upon request. If, following a review of the legality of such a request under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the third country of destination, it should challenge it, including, where appropriate, by exhausting available possibilities of appeal. In any event, if the data importer is no longer able to comply with the standard contractual clauses, it should inform the data exporter accordingly, including where this is the consequence of a request for disclosure.

 

(23)

As stakeholder needs, technology and processing operations may change, the Commission should evaluate the operation of the standard contractual clauses in the light of experience, as part of the periodic evaluation of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 referred to in Article 97 of that Regulation.

 

(24)

Decision 2001/497/EC and Decision 2010/87/EU should be repealed three months after the entry into force of this Decision. During that period, data exporters and data importers should, for the purpose of Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, still be able to use the standard contractual clauses set out in Decisions 2001/497/EC and 2010/87/EU. For an additional period of 15 months, data exporters and data importers should, for the purpose of Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, be able to continue to rely on standard contractual clauses set out in Decisions 2001/497/EC and 2010/87/EU for the performance of contracts concluded between them before the date of repeal of those decisions, provided that the processing operations that are the subject matter of the contract remain unchanged and that reliance on the clauses ensures that the transfer of personal data is subject to appropriate safeguards within the meaning of Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In the event of relevant changes to the contract, the data exporter should be required to rely on a new ground for data transfers under the contract, in particular by replacing the existing standard contractual clauses with the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision. The same should apply to any sub-contracting to a (sub-)processor of processing operations covered by the contract.

 

(25)

The European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board were consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered a joint opinion on 14 January 2021 [(12)](#ntr12-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0012), which has been taken into consideration in the preparation of this Decision.

 

(26)

The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 93 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:

Article 1

1.   The standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex are considered to provide appropriate safeguards within the meaning of Article 46(1) and (2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for the transfer by a controller or processor of personal data processed subject to that Regulation (data exporter) to a controller or (sub-)processor whose processing of the data is not subject to that Regulation (data importer).

2.   The standard contractual clauses also set out the rights and obligations of controllers and processors with respect to the matters referred to in Article 28(3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as regards the transfer of personal data from a controller to a processor, or from a processor to a sub-processor.

Article 2

Where the competent Member State authorities exercise corrective powers pursuant to Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in response to the data importer being or becoming subject to laws or practices in the third country of destination that prevent it from complying with the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex, leading to the suspension or ban of data transfers to third countries, the Member State concerned shall, without delay, inform the Commission, which will forward the information to the other Member States.

Article 3

The Commission shall evaluate the practical application of the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex on the basis of all available information, as part of the periodic evaluation required by Article 97 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Article 4

1.   This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

2.   Decision 2001/497/EC is repealed with effect from 27 September 2021.

3.   Decision 2010/87/EU is repealed with effect from 27 September 2021.

4.   Contracts concluded before 27 September 2021 on the basis of Decision 2001/497/EC or Decision 2010/87/EU shall be deemed to provide appropriate safeguards within the meaning of Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 until 27 December 2022, provided the processing operations that are the subject matter of the contract remain unchanged and that reliance on those clauses ensures that the transfer of personal data is subject to appropriate safeguards.

ANNEX

STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES

SECTION I

Clause 1

Purpose and scope

 

(a)

The purpose of these standard contractual clauses is to ensure compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) [(1)](#ntr1-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0001) for the transfer of personal data to a third country.

 

(b)

The Parties:

 

(i)

the natural or legal person(s), public authority/ies, agency/ies or other body/ies (hereinafter ‘entity/ies’) transferring the personal data, as listed in Annex I.A (hereinafter each ‘data exporter’), and

 

(ii)

the entity/ies in a third country receiving the personal data from the data exporter, directly or indirectly via another entity also Party to these Clauses, as listed in Annex I.A (hereinafter each ‘data importer’)

have agreed to these standard contractual clauses (hereinafter: ‘Clauses’).

 

(c)

These Clauses apply with respect to the transfer of personal data as specified in Annex I.B.

 

(d)

The Appendix to these Clauses containing the Annexes referred to therein forms an integral part of these Clauses.

Clause 2

Effect and invariability of the Clauses

 

(a)

These Clauses set out appropriate safeguards, including enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies, pursuant to Article 46(1) and Article 46(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, with respect to data transfers from controllers to processors and/or processors to processors, standard contractual clauses pursuant to Article 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided they are not modified, except to select the appropriate Module(s) or to add or update information in the Appendix. This does not prevent the Parties from including the standard contractual clauses laid down in these Clauses in a wider contract and/or to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, these Clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects.

 

(b)

These Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to which the data exporter is subject by virtue of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Clause 3

Third-party beneficiaries

 

(a)

Data subjects may invoke and enforce these Clauses, as third-party beneficiaries, against the data exporter and/or data importer, with the following exceptions:

(vii)

Clause 16(e);

 

(viii)

Clause 18 – Modules One, Two and Three: Clause 18(a) and (b); Module Four: Clause 18.

 

(b)

Paragraph (a) is without prejudice to rights of data subjects under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Clause 4

Interpretation

 

(a)

Where these Clauses use terms that are defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, those terms shall have the same meaning as in that Regulation.

 

(b)

These Clauses shall be read and interpreted in the light of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

 

(c)

These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that conflicts with rights and obligations provided for in Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Clause 5

Hierarchy

In the event of a contradiction between these Clauses and the provisions of related agreements between the Parties, existing at the time these Clauses are agreed or entered into thereafter, these Clauses shall prevail.

Clause 6

Description of the transfer(s)

The details of the transfer(s), and in particular the categories of personal data that are transferred and the purpose(s) for which they are transferred, are specified in Annex I.B.

Clause 7 – Optional

Docking clause

 

(a)

An entity that is not a Party to these Clauses may, with the agreement of the Parties, accede to these Clauses at any time, either as a data exporter or as a data importer, by completing the Appendix and signing Annex I.A.

 

(b)

Once it has completed the Appendix and signed Annex I.A, the acceding entity shall become a Party to these Clauses and have the rights and obligations of a data exporter or data importer in accordance with its designation in Annex I.A.

 

(c)

The acceding entity shall have no rights or obligations arising under these Clauses from the period prior to becoming a Party.

SECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES

Clause 8

Data protection safeguards

The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.

MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller

8.1   Purpose limitation

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B. It may only process the personal data for another purpose:

 

(i)

where it has obtained the data subject’s prior consent;

 

(ii)

where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or

 

(iii)

where necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.

8.2   Transparency

 

(a)

In order to enable data subjects to effectively exercise their rights pursuant to Clause 10, the data importer shall inform them, either directly or through the data exporter:

 

(i)

of its identity and contact details;

 

(ii)

of the categories of personal data processed;

 

(iii)

of the right to obtain a copy of these Clauses;

 

(iv)

where it intends to onward transfer the personal data to any third party/ies, of the recipient or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information), the purpose of such onward transfer and the ground therefore pursuant to Clause 8.7.

 

(b)

Paragraph (a) shall not apply where the data subject already has the information, including when such information has already been provided by the data exporter, or providing the information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort for the data importer. In the latter case, the data importer shall, to the extent possible, make the information publicly available.

 

(c)

On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the Parties may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.

 

(d)

Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

8.3   Accuracy and data minimisation

 

(a)

Each Party shall ensure that the personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The data importer shall take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purpose(s) of processing, is erased or rectified without delay.

 

(b)

If one of the Parties becomes aware that the personal data it has transferred or received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.

 

(c)

The data importer shall ensure that the personal data is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) of processing.

8.4   Storage limitation

The data importer shall retain the personal data for no longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed. It shall put in place appropriate technical or organisational measures to ensure compliance with this obligation, including erasure or anonymisation [(2)](#ntr2-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0002) of the data and all back-ups at the end of the retention period.

8.5   Security of processing

 

(a)

The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the personal data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.

 

(b)

The Parties have agreed on the technical and organisational measures set out in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.

 

(c)

The data importer shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

 

(d)

In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

 

(e)

In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall without undue delay notify both the data exporter and the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13. Such notification shall contain i) a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), ii) its likely consequences, iii) the measures taken or proposed to address the breach, and iv) the details of a contact point from whom more information can be obtained. To the extent it is not possible for the data importer to provide all the information at the same time, it may do so in phases without undue further delay.

 

(f)

In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall also notify without undue delay the data subjects concerned of the personal data breach and its nature, if necessary in cooperation with the data exporter, together with the information referred to in paragraph (e), points ii) to iv), unless the data importer has implemented measures to significantly reduce the risk to the rights or freedoms of natural persons, or notification would involve disproportionate efforts. In the latter case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal data breach.

 

(g)

The data importer shall document all relevant facts relating to the personal data breach, including its effects and any remedial action taken, and keep a record thereof.

8.6   Sensitive data

Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards adapted to the specific nature of the data and the risks involved. This may include restricting the personnel permitted to access the personal data, additional security measures (such as pseudonymisation) and/or additional restrictions with respect to further disclosure.

8.7   Onward transfers

The data importer shall not disclose the personal data to a third party located outside the European Union [(3)](#ntr3-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0003) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) unless the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module. Otherwise, an onward transfer by the data importer may only take place if:

 

(i)

it is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;

 

(ii)

the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;

 

(iii)

the third party enters into a binding instrument with the data importer ensuring the same level of data protection as under these Clauses, and the data importer provides a copy of these safeguards to the data exporter;

 

(iv)

Clause 13

Supervision

MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller

MODULE TWO: Transfer controller to processor

MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor

 

(a)

\[Where the data exporter is established in an EU Member State:\] The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.

\[Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:\] The supervisory authority of the Member State in which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.

\[Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:\] The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.

 

(b)

The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.

SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES

Clause 14

Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses

MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller

MODULE TWO: Transfer controller to processor

MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor

MODULE FOUR: Transfer processor to controller (where the EU processor combines the personal data received from the third country-controller with personal data collected by the processor in the EU)

 

(a)

The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.

 

(b)

The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:

 

(i)

the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;

 

(ii)

the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards [(12)](#ntr12-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0012);

 

(iii)

any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.

 

(c)

The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.

 

(d)

The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

 

(e)

The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a). \[For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the notification to the controller.\]

 

(f)

Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation \[for Module Three:, if appropriate in consultation with the controller\]. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by \[for Module Three: the controller or\] the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.

Clause 15

Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities

MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller

MODULE TWO: Transfer controller to processor

MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor

MODULE FOUR: Transfer processor to controller (where the EU processor combines the personal data received from the third country-controller with personal data collected by the processor in the EU)

15.1   Notification

 

(a)

The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:

 

(i)

receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or

 

(ii)

becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.

\[For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the notification to the controller.\]

 

(b)

If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.

 

(c)

Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.). \[For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the information to the controller.\]

 

(d)

The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

 

(e)

Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.

15.2   Review of legality and data minimisation

 

(a)

The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).

 

(b)

The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request. \[For Module Three: The data exporter shall make the assessment available to the controller.\]

 

(c)

The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

SECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS

Clause 16

Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination

 

(a)

The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.

 

(b)

In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).

 

(c)

The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:

 

(i)

the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;

 

(ii)

the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or

 

(iii)

the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.

In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority \[for Module Three: and the controller\] of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.

 

(d)

\[For Modules One, Two and Three: Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data.\] \[For Module Four: Personal data collected by the data exporter in the EU that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall immediately be deleted in its entirety, including any copy thereof.\] The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.

 

(e)

Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Clause 17

Governing law

MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller

MODULE TWO: Transfer controller to processor

MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor

\[OPTION 1: These Clauses shall be governed by the law of one of the EU Member States, provided such law allows for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (specify Member State).\]

\[OPTION 2 (for Modules Two and Three): These Clauses shall be governed by the law of the EU Member State in which the data exporter is established. Where such law does not allow for third-party beneficiary rights, they shall be governed by the law of another EU Member State that does allow for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (specify Member State).\]

MODULE FOUR: Transfer processor to controller

These Clauses shall be governed by the law of a country allowing for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (specify country).

[(1)](#ntc1-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0001)  Where the data exporter is a processor subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 acting on behalf of a Union institution or body as controller, reliance on these Clauses when engaging another processor (sub-processing) not subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also ensures compliance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC ([OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39](./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC)), to the extent these Clauses and the data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 29(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are aligned. This will in particular be the case where the controller and processor rely on the standard contractual clauses included in Decision 2021/915.

[(2)](#ntc2-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0002)  This requires rendering the data anonymous in such a way that the individual is no longer identifiable by anyone, in line with recital 26 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and that this process is irreversible.

[(3)](#ntc3-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0003)  The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.

[(4)](#ntc4-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0004)  The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.

[(5)](#ntc5-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0005)  See Article 28(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, where the controller is an EU institution or body, Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.

[(6)](#ntc6-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0006)  The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purposes of these Clauses.

[(7)](#ntc7-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0007)  This includes whether the transfer and further processing involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences.

[(8)](#ntc8-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0008)  This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in accordance with Clause 7.

[(9)](#ntc9-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0009)  This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in accordance with Clause 7.

[(10)](#ntc10-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0010)  That period may be extended by a maximum of two more months, to the extent necessary taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The data importer shall duly and promptly inform the data subject of any such extension.

[(11)](#ntc11-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0011)  The data importer may offer independent dispute resolution through an arbitration body only if it is established in a country that has ratified the New York Convention on Enforcement of Arbitration Awards.

[(12)](#ntc12-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0012)  As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies.

* * *

APPENDIX

EXPLANATORY NOTE:

It must be possible to clearly distinguish the information applicable to each transfer or category of transfers and, in this regard, to determine the respective role(s) of the Parties as data exporter(s) and/or data importer(s). This does not necessarily require completing and signing separate appendices for each transfer/category of transfers and/or contractual relationship, where this transparency can achieved through one appendix. However, where necessary to ensure sufficient clarity, separate appendices should be used.
