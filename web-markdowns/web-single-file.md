    Algolia
    Algolia
    Algolia AI Search can power search for any kind of content. Actually Algolia doesn’t directly search in your original data source, but in the data you submit, which Algolia hosts on its servers.
    All the unused credits will expire/lapse after 12 months. Apply [here](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=5005635939217 "here") to be part of the program. 
    An index is the place where the data used by a search engine is stored. An index is to search what a “table” is for a database. Unlike a database table, an index is optimized for search operations. For example, in an ecommerce website, the index would be a complete list of all products with a custom ranking.
    Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.
    At the heart of GitHub is an open-source version control system (VCS) called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer.
    Both solutions use large language models (LLMs) to provide results, but they solve very different problems.

*   **Only with a search warrant** — We will not disclose the private contents of any account unless compelled to do so under a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures upon a showing of probable cause. In addition to the non-public account information and account access logs mentioned above, we will also provide private account contents in response to a search warrant, which may include:
*   **Organization account data** — Information about organizations, their administrative users and repositories is publicly available on GitHub. Organization profiles can be found at a URL such as `https://github.com/organization`. Public organization profiles can also include additional information that the owners have chosen to share publicly. All organization public profiles display:
*   **Other data** — Additionally, GitHub collects analytics data such as page visits and information occasionally volunteered by our users (such as communications with our support team, survey information and/or site registrations).
*   **Private account data** — GitHub also collects and maintains certain private information about users as outlined in our [Privacy Policy](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). This may include:
*   **Private repository data** — GitHub collects and maintains the same type of data for private repositories that can be seen for public repositories, except only specifically invited users may access private repository data.
*   **Public account data** — There is a variety of information publicly available on GitHub about users and their repositories. User profiles can be found at a URL such as `https://github.com/username`. User profiles display information about when the user created their account as well their public activity on GitHub.com and social interactions. Public user profiles can also include additional information that a user may have chosen to share publicly. All user public profiles display:
*   **Public repository data** — GitHub is home to millions of public, open-source software projects. You can browse almost any public repository (for example, the [GitHub Docs](https://github.com/github/docs)) to get a sense for the information that GitHub collects and maintains about repositories. This can include:
*   **Under exigent circumstances** — If we receive a request for information under certain exigent circumstances (where we believe the disclosure is necessary to prevent an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to a person), we may disclose limited information that we determine necessary to enable law enforcement to address the emergency. For any information beyond that, we would require a subpoena, search warrant, or court order, as described above. For example, we will not disclose contents of private repositories without a search warrant. Before disclosing information, we confirm that the request came from a law enforcement agency, an authority sent an official notice summarizing the emergency, and how the information requested will assist in addressing the emergency.
*   **With a court order _or_ a search warrant** — We will not disclose account access logs unless compelled to do so by either (i) a court order issued under 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d), upon a showing of specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation; or (ii) a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures, upon a showing of probable cause. In addition to the non-public account information listed above, we can provide account access logs in response to a court order or search warrant, which may include:
*   **With a subpoena** — If served with a valid subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar legal process issued in connection with an official criminal or civil investigation, we can provide certain non-public account information, which may include:
*   **With user consent** — GitHub will provide private account information, if requested, directly to the user (or an owner, in the case of an organization account), or to a designated third party with the user's written consent once GitHub is satisfied that the user has verified his or her identity.
*   1 This 7X times factor is based on data from the industry’s longest running analysis of fix rates Veracode State of Software Security 2023, which cites the average time to fix 50% of flaws as 198 days vs. GitHub’s fix rates of 72% of flaws with in 28 days which is at a minimum of 7X faster when compared.

We may also employ third-party Cookies to gather data for interest-based advertising. In some jurisdictions, we only use non-essential cookies after obtaining your consent. See [this](#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls) section for more details and control options.
*   Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:
*   One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).

If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.
*   You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.
*   You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

*   You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
*   You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

*   [**Collaborators**](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary#collaborator) — A collaborator is a user with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner.
*   [**Gists**](/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) — Gists are snippets of source code or other text that users can use to store ideas or share with friends. Like regular GitHub repositories, Gists are created with Git, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and downloadable. Gists can either be public or secret (accessible only through a known URL). Public Gists cannot be converted into secret Gists.
*   [**Organizations**](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary#organization) — Organizations are a group of two or more users that typically mirror real-world organizations, such as businesses or projects. They are administered by users and can contain both repositories and teams of users.
*   [**Pages**](/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) — GitHub Pages are public webpages freely hosted by GitHub that users can easily publish through code stored in their repositories. If a user or organization has a GitHub Page, it can usually be found at a URL such as `https://username.github.io` or they may have the webpage mapped to their own custom domain name.
*   [**Repositories**](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary#repository) — A repository is one of the most basic GitHub elements. They may be easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and, at its administrators' discretion, may be publicly viewable or not.
*   [**Users**](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary#user) — Users are represented in our system as personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories. Users can create or be invited to join organizations or to collaborate on another user's repository.

**Benefits to Using the ICDR-AAA  
**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).
**Crash Reports** - Crash reports collect diagnostic information when VS Code crashes and sends it to Microsoft to help understand why the crash occurred and what changes are needed to prevent the crash in the future.
**Current:**  
**Do Not Track** (**DNT**) is a formerly official HTTP header field, designed to allow internet users to opt-out of tracking by websites—which includes the collection of data regarding a user's activity across multiple distinct contexts, and the retention, use, or sharing of data derived from that activity outside the context in which it occurred.
**Error Telemetry** - Error telemetry collects information about errors that do not crash the application but are unexpected.
**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.
**For further information on the ICDR-AAA Data Privacy Framework, please call or email Luis Martinez at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#48052921243c277205293a3c21262d320408292c3a66273a2f)** **or at +1.212.716.5833 or Alyssa Montano at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5f123e36332b30651230312b3e31301e1f3e3b2d71302d38) +1.212.484.3281.**
**Global Privacy Control** (GPC) is a proposed HTTP header field and DOM property that can be used to inform websites of the user's wish to have their information not be sold or used by ad trackers. GPC was developed in 2020 by privacy technology researchers such as Wesleyan University professor Sebastian Zimmeck and former Chief Technologist of the Federal Trade Commission Ashkan Soltani, as well as a group of privacy-focused companies including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Automattic (owner of Tumblr and WordPress), and more.

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.
**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears.

> “40 million consumers are now using web browsers and other privacy tools that support this global opt out. Major publishers, the New York Times, Washington Post, have already pledged to respect it. California's Attorney General has already said that companies must respect GPC. This is a big step in Americans privacy, a big, big step forward.”

> “Algolia's powerful SaaS solution does the heavy lifting for our small development team. Indexing APIs and other functionalities come in handy when it comes to promo changes, price updates, and ranking. Also, Algolia's out-of-the-box UI integration provides a great base for developing complex UI use cases.”
> “Algolia’s federated search helps us facilitate seamless customer experiences by empowering our employees to easily and quickly find the relevant information and resources they need to do their job every day.”
> “CA DOJ is encouraged to see the technology community developing a global privacy control in furtherance of the CCPA and consumer privacy rights.”
> “CCPA requires businesses to treat a user-enabled global privacy control as a legally valid consumer request to opt out of the sale of their data. CCPA opened the door to developing a technical standard, like the GPC, which satisfies this legal requirement & protects privacy.”
> “GPC provides a clear and binary indication of an individual's choice... Based on a review of several of the web browsers' intentions regarding GPC, it appears likely to be a prominent, easily understandable, and accessible mechanism in the browser settings.”

> “My hope is that Governor Northam and the legislature will improve \[the newly passed Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act\] in the near future in important ways... making it easier for Virginia citizens to invoke their privacy rights, such as through a global privacy control.”
> “Search plays a huge part in user experience,” Saravana says. “These days no one wants to have a hierarchical navigation to find content. You don’t go to a library and look for fiction section and then drill down to try to find the Game of Thrones novel. It’s not going to work. You go to the help desk tool and type in ‘game of thrones.’ and locate the book right away!”
> “The API and SDK options are really great, and the ability to handle traffic at scale. We have a high volume and Algolia is very fast — able to keep up with our level of traffic.”
> “The Algolia Merchandising Studio has helped visualise our data in a more concise and in-depth manner. The ability to understand our analytics and create rules based off visualising customer queries all in two clicks, means we can react to customer behaviour and trends in a more time efficient way.”
> “The Merchandising Studio gives powerful control by surfacing insights and automating their promotions. I can move seamlessly across categories and product assortments, apply changes quickly and easily. Freeing myself up to use my creativity and category knowledge to attract more customers and beat the competition.”
> “The design of the InstantSearch React library is really elegant and helps us build the things we want and the way we want them with flexibility out of the box,” Kahn says. “In fact, things that we know we can get from Algolia are generally less work than fetching it internally or building out systems internally to fetch that data.”
> “What’s nice about Algolia is that I can change the ranking algorithm and the UI without needing developer help,” Cho says. “Or, I can implement various rules. For example, ‘if the user types in YOSEM, the search function will always pin Yosemite National Park to the first ranked result.’ Those are things I can implement and see in action quickly.”

A controller or processor may use the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision to provide appropriate safeguards within the meaning of Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for the transfer of personal data to a processor or controller established in a third country, without prejudice to the interpretation of the notion of international transfer in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The standard contractual clauses may be used for such transfers only to the extent that the processing by the importer does not fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. This also includes the transfer of personal data by a controller or processor not established in the Union, to the extent that the processing is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (pursuant to Article 3(2) thereof), because it relates to the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the Union or the monitoring of their behaviour as far as it takes place within the Union.

Advertising
Advertising fuels the internet's economy. In order to use the services we have come to expect from the web, such as social media, free email accounts, websites we visit, apps we use and more, these services need to be funded.
Advertising, like many other forms of media, funds these platforms. When ad targeting is done right, it's relevant and timely.
After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data exporter shall, at the choice of the data importer, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data importer and certify to the data importer that it has done so, or return to the data importer all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies.

Algolia is a hosted search engine, offering full-text, numerical, and faceted search, capable of delivering real-time results from the first keystroke. Algolia's powerful API lets you quickly and seamlessly implement search within your websites and mobile applications. Our search API powers billions of queries for thousands of companies every month, delivering relevant results in under 100ms anywhere in the world.
Algolia is in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Search and Product Discovery positioned furthest for Completeness of Vision. Learn more by downloading a copy of the report.
Algolia returns 20 hits by default, but you can override any [search parameters](/doc/api-reference/search-api-parameters/) with [`<Configure>`](/doc/api-reference/widgets/configure/react/). This widget doesn’t render anything, but still instructs InstantSearch to send custom search parameters to Algolia.
Algolia supports [highlighting](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/features/#highlighting-and-snippeting) and returns the highlighted parts of a hit in the response. You can use the [`<Highlight>`](/doc/api-reference/widgets/highlight/react/) widget to highlight matches in each attribute.
Algolia's three unique capabilities
Algolia’s AI search suite has unique strengths
Algolia’s no-code connector platform now has connectors for your Elasticsearch instances and MySQL databases. Index your data and schedule regular updates without writing custom code.
Algolia’s search combines multiple models and signals. Models like Dynamic Re-Ranking and Personalization understand your users. And inputs like Business Signals and our Merchandizing Studio account for your commercial objectives.

Are you a law enforcement officer conducting an investigation that may involve user content hosted on GitHub? Or maybe you're a privacy-conscious person who would like to know what information we share with law enforcement and under what circumstances. Either way, you're on the right page.

Article 3
Article 4
As a United States company based in California, GitHub is not required to provide data to foreign governments in response to legal process issued by foreign authorities. Foreign law enforcement officials wishing to request information from GitHub should contact the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs. GitHub will promptly respond to requests that are issued via U.S. court by way of a mutual legal assistance treaty (“MLAT”) or letter rogatory.
As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.
As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please contact us via email at [info\[at\]globalprivacycontrol.org](mailto:info%5Bat%5Dglobalprivacycontrol.org).

As stakeholder needs, technology and processing operations may change, the Commission should evaluate the operation of the standard contractual clauses in the light of experience, as part of the periodic evaluation of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 referred to in Article 97 of that Regulation.
As the Rubin Observatory is not funded to provide support for the LSST Science Pipelines outside of the project, any support provided by project members will come out of their own free or science time. A fair way to acknowledge their help and good will may be to offer co-authorship on technical papers describing the derived software (e.g. pipelines).

Basics
Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.
Before asking us to disclose data, it may be useful to understand how our system is implemented. GitHub hosts millions of data repositories using the [Git version control system](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control). Repositories on GitHub—which may be public or private—are most commonly used for software development projects, but are also often used to work on content of all kinds.
Before you begin

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**
Beyond crash reporting and telemetry, VS Code uses online services for various other purposes such as downloading product updates, finding, installing, and updating extensions, Settings Sync, or providing Natural Language Search within the Settings editor. You can choose to turn on/off features that use these services.
Beyond using standard contractual clauses to provide appropriate safeguards for transfers pursuant to Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the data exporter has to fulfil its general responsibilities as controller or processor under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Those responsibilities include an obligation of the controller to provide data subjects with information about the fact that it intends to transfer their personal data to a third country pursuant to Article 13(1)(f) and Article 14(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In the case of transfers pursuant to Article 46 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, such information must include a reference to the appropriate safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or information where they have been made available.

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.
By creating an account, you agree to the [Terms of Service](/site/terms). For more information about GitHub's privacy practices, see the [GitHub Privacy Statement](/site/privacy). We'll occasionally send you account-related emails.
By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.
By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:
By providing guidelines for law enforcement personnel, we hope to strike a balance between the often competing interests of user privacy and justice. We hope these guidelines will help to set expectations on both sides, as well as to add transparency to GitHub's internal processes. Our users should know that we value their private information and that we do what we can to protect it. At a minimum, this means only releasing data to third-parties when the appropriate legal requirements have been satisfied. By the same token, we also hope to educate law enforcement professionals about GitHub's systems so that they can more efficiently tailor their data requests and target just that information needed to conduct their investigation.
By submitting legal process to GitHub, you attest that the legal process does not relate to the violation of any law that creates liability for abortion-related conduct that is lawful in California.

Code Exchange | AlgoliaCode search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see "[Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)."
Code search is case-insensitive. Searching for `True` will include results for _uppercase_ `TRUE` and _lowercase_ `true`. You cannot do case-sensitive searches. Regular expression searches (e.g. for `[t][H][i][S]`) are also case-insensitive, and thus would return `This`, `THIS` and `this` in addition to any instances of `tHiS`.Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.
Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.
Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

Decision 2001/497/EC and Decision 2010/87/EU should be repealed three months after the entry into force of this Decision. During that period, data exporters and data importers should, for the purpose of Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, still be able to use the standard contractual clauses set out in Decisions 2001/497/EC and 2010/87/EU. For an additional period of 15 months, data exporters and data importers should, for the purpose of Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, be able to continue to rely on standard contractual clauses set out in Decisions 2001/497/EC and 2010/87/EU for the performance of contracts concluded between them before the date of repeal of those decisions, provided that the processing operations that are the subject matter of the contract remain unchanged and that reliance on the clauses ensures that the transfer of personal data is subject to appropriate safeguards within the meaning of Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In the event of relevant changes to the contract, the data exporter should be required to rely on a new ground for data transfers under the contract, in particular by replacing the existing standard contractual clauses with the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision. The same should apply to any sub-contracting to a (sub-)processor of processing operations covered by the contract.

Felis is a way of describing database catalogs, scientific and otherwise, in a language and DBMS agnostic way. It’s built on concepts from JSON-LD/RDF and CSVW, but intended to provide a comprehensive way to describe tabular data, using annotations on tables, columns, and schemas, to document scientifically useful metadata as well as implementation-specific metadata for database management systems, file formats, and application data models.

Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation \[for Module Three:, if appropriate in consultation with the controller\]. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by \[for Module Three: the controller or\] the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.

For example, if you don't want to send any telemetry data to Microsoft, you can set the `telemetry.telemetryLevel` user [setting](/docs/getstarted/settings) to `off`.
For example, running `code --telemetry > telemetry.json && code telemetry.json` will create a `telemetry.json` file in your current working directory and then open it in VS Code. You cannot pipe the output like this, `code --telemetry | code -`, due to the length of the telemetry report.
For example, the following query:

GDPR and VS Code
GPC is a valid do-not-sell-my-personal-information signal according to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which stipulates that websites are legally required to respect a signal sent by users who want to opt-out of having their personal data sold. In July 2021, the California Attorney General clarified through an FAQ that under law, the Global Privacy Control signal must be honored.
GPC is available as part of several major browsers, extensions, and websites.
GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions, listed [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download). If you want to use GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser extension. More information about downloading GPC is available [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).
GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders: technologists, web publishers, technology companies, browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and civil rights organizations.
GPC lets users signal their desired privacy, just by browsing.
GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Privacy Community Group](https://privacycg.github.io/) (Privacy CG) in April 2020. A number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with the proposal [here](https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/10/).

Given the general alignment of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [(8)](#ntr8-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0008), it should be possible to use the standard contractual clauses also in the context of a contract, as referred to in Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 for the transfer of personal data to a sub-processor in a third country by a processor that is not a Union institution or body, but which is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and which processes personal data on behalf of a Union institution or body in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. Provided the contract reflects the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 29(3) Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in particular by providing sufficient guarantees for technical and organisational measures to ensure that the processing meets the requirements of that Regulation, this will ensure compliance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. In particular, that will be the case where the controller and processor use the standard contractual clauses in Commission Implementing Decision on standard contractual clauses between controllers and processors under Article 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Article 29(7) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council [(9)](#ntr9-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0009).

Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a proposed specification designed to allow Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the specification.

If one of the Parties becomes aware that the personal data it has transferred or received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.
If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.
If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to rectify or erase the data.
If the data importer intends to refuse a data subject’s request, it shall inform the data subject of the reasons for the refusal and the possibility of lodging a complaint with the competent supervisory authority and/or seeking judicial redress.
If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.
If you live in Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia you have some additional rights:
If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.
If you try typing in the search box, you won’t see any hits on the page yet. However, the component is connected to Algolia and is already sending queries: if you open the **Network** tabs in your browser’s developer tools, you can see network requests going out on every keystroke. InstantSearch adds the input value in the “query” [`uiState`](/doc/api-reference/widgets/ui-state/js/), which is then converted to search parameters and sent to Algolia.
If you use the JSON editor for your settings, add the following line:

If you'd like to review the telemetry events in VS Code as they are sent, you can enable tracing and it will record telemetry events. Using the **Developer: Set Log Level...** command and select log level **Trace**. To view the logging output, go to the Output panel (⇧⌘U (Windows Ctrl+Shift+U, Linux Ctrl+K Ctrl+H)) and pick **Telemetry** from the dropdown.
If you'd like to view all the possible telemetry events that VS Code could send, you can use the `--telemetry` flag in the CLI. This will generate a JSON report that you can then view within VS Code. These reports are generated per build and do not contain extension telemetry unless the extension author adds a `telemetry.json` file to their root build directory.

In 2007, several consumer advocacy groups asked the U.S. [Federal Trade Commission](/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission "Federal Trade Commission") to create a Do Not Track list for online advertising. The proposal would have required that online advertisers submit their information to the FTC, which would compile a machine-readable list of the domain names used by those companies to place cookies or otherwise track consumers.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)
In 2020, a coalition of US-based internet companies announced the **Global Privacy Control** header that spiritually succeeds Do Not Track header. The creators hope that this new header will meet the definition of "user-enabled global privacy controls" defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this case, the new header would be automatically strengthened by existing laws and companies would be required to honor it.
In 2023, Google made changes known as "Manifest V3" to the WebRequest API used by [ad blocking](/wiki/Ad_blocking "Ad blocking") and privacy extensions to block and modify network connections.[\[48\]](#cite_note-:1-48)[\[49\]](#cite_note-49) Following Google's implementation of Manifest V3 and the end of support for V2, uBlock Origin's effectiveness is drastically reduced in [Google Chrome](/wiki/Google_Chrome "Google Chrome") and other [Chromium](/wiki/Chromium_\(web_browser\) "Chromium (web browser)")\-based browsers.[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)[\[52\]](#cite_note-52) The alternative 'uBlock Origin Lite' for Chromium browsers lacks filter list updates outside of extension updates, and has no custom filters, strict-blocked pages, per-site switches, or dynamic filtering. Non-Chromium browsers such as [Firefox](/wiki/Firefox "Firefox") are unaffected.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53) Google has been criticized for implementing some of these features due to its domination in the online advertising market.[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)[\[56\]](#cite_note-56)[\[57\]](#cite_note-57)
In August 2015 a coalition of privacy groups led by the Electronic Frontier Foundation using W3C's Tracking Preference Expression (DNT) standard proposed that "Do not track" be the goal for advocates to demand of businesses.[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)
In Canada, complaints are accepted and addressed through the independent enforcement body, Ad Standards.  
In Canada, you have privacy rights that companies need to adhere to - and that’s why you see the blue icon - it’s there to inform and empower you to take control.
In December 2010, the FTC issued a privacy report that called for a "do-not-track" system that would enable people to avoid having their actions being monitored online.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
In January 2016, uBlock Origin was added to the repositories for [Debian](/wiki/Debian "Debian") 9 and [Ubuntu](/wiki/Ubuntu "Ubuntu") 16.04.[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)[\[32\]](#cite_note-32) The extension was awarded "Pick of the Month" by [Mozilla](/wiki/Mozilla "Mozilla") for May 2016.[\[33\]](#cite_note-pickofmonth-33)
In January 2019, the W3C Tracking Protection Working Group was disbanded, citing "insufficient deployment of these extensions" and lack of "indications of planned support among user agents, third parties, and the ecosystem at large".[\[13\]](#cite_note-GitHub_note_W3C_DNT_disbanded-13)[\[14\]](#cite_note-Gizmodo_Apple_Removing_Do_Not_Track-14) Beginning the following month, Apple removed DNT support from Safari, citing that it could be used as a "[fingerprinting](/wiki/Browser_fingerprinting "Browser fingerprinting") variable" for tracking.[\[15\]](#cite_note-apple_fingerprinting-15)
In July 2009, researchers Christopher Soghoian and Sid Stamm implemented support for the Do Not Track header in the Firefox web browser via a prototype add-on. Stamm was, at the time, a privacy engineer at Mozilla, while Soghoian soon afterward started working at the FTC.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3) One year later, during a U.S. Senate privacy hearing, FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz told the Senate Commerce Committee that the commission was exploring the idea of proposing a "do-not-track" list.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
In July 2018, ublock.org was acquired by [AdBlock](/wiki/AdBlock "AdBlock") and resumed development.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23) From February 2019, uBlock began allowing users to participate in "acceptable ads",[\[24\]](#cite_note-24)[\[25\]](#cite_note-25) a program run by Adblock Plus that allows some ads deemed "acceptable" and nonintrusive, and for which larger publishers pay a fee.[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)
In November 2019, a uBlock Origin user reported a novel technique used by some sites to bypass third-party tracker blocking. These sites link to URLs that are sub-domains of the page's domain, but those sub-domains resolve to third-party hosts via a [CNAME record](/wiki/CNAME_record "CNAME record"). Since the initial URL contained a sub-domain of the current page, it was interpreted by browsers as a first-party request and so was allowed by the filtering rules in uBlock Origin (and in similar extensions). The uBlock Origin developer came up with a solution using a DNS API which is exclusive to Firefox 60+.[\[41\]](#cite_note-41) The new feature was implemented in uBlock Origin 1.25, released on February 19, 2020.[\[42\]](#cite_note-42)
In October 2020, following security disclosures by the Google Security Team, Privacy Badger changed its default behavior. While it would previously learn to block new trackers heuristically after installed, it now defaults to blocking only trackers it already knows from automated testing before release. While it can still be configured to learn heuristically, it is no longer the default option because it can be exploited by third-parties to fingerprint the user based on trackers it blocks.[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)
In addition to supporting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the VS Code team takes privacy very seriously. That's both for Microsoft as a company and specifically within the VS Code team.
In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history.
In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.
In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall also notify without undue delay the data subjects concerned of the personal data breach and its nature, if necessary in cooperation with the data exporter, together with the information referred to in paragraph (e), points ii) to iv), unless the data importer has implemented measures to significantly reduce the risk to the rights or freedoms of natural persons, or notification would involve disproportionate efforts. In the latter case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal data breach.
In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall without undue delay notify both the data exporter and the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13. Such notification shall contain i) a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), ii) its likely consequences, iii) the measures taken or proposed to address the breach, and iv) the details of a contact point from whom more information can be obtained. To the extent it is not possible for the data importer to provide all the information at the same time, it may do so in phases without undue further delay.
In cases where your organization grants access to GitHub products, GitHub acts as the Data Controller solely for specific processing activities. These activities are clearly defined in a contractual agreement with your organization, known as a Data Protection Agreement. You can review our standard Data Protection Agreement at [GitHub Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). For those limited purposes, this Statement governs the handling of your Personal Data. For all other aspects of GitHub product usage, your organization's policies apply.
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact GitHub at: dpo\[at\]github\[dot\]com.
In force
In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the controller, as communicated by the data exporter.
In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.
In order to enable data subjects to effectively exercise their rights pursuant to Clause 10, the data importer shall inform them, either directly or through the data exporter:
In order to ensure compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Program (the EU-U.S. DPF and, as applicable the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF) organizations must have in place an appropriate Independent Recourse Mechanism for each type of personal data covered by Its self-certification. Under the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle, self-certifying organizations must provide an independent recourse mechanism available to investigate unresolved complaints brought under the DPF Principles and provide appropriate recourse free of charge to the affected individual.  
In order to ensure effective enforcement, the data importer should be required to submit to the jurisdiction of such authority and courts, and to commit to abide by any binding decision under the applicable Member State law. In particular, the data importer should agree to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. In addition, the data importer should have the option of offering data subjects the opportunity to seek redress before an independent dispute resolution body, at no cost. In line with Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data subjects should be allowed to be represented by associations or other bodies in disputes against the data importer if they so wish.
In order to provide appropriate safeguards, the standard contractual clauses should ensure that the personal data transferred on that basis is afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the Union [(10)](#ntr10-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0010). With a view to ensuring transparency of processing, data subjects should be provided with a copy of the standard contractual clauses and be informed, in particular, of the categories of personal data processed, the right to obtain a copy of the standard contractual clauses, and any onward transfer. Onward transfers by the data importer to a third party in another third country should be allowed only if the third party accedes to the standard contractual clauses, if the continuity of protection is ensured otherwise, or in specific situations, such as on the basis of the explicit, informed consent of the data subject.
In particular, upon request by the data subject the data importer shall, free of charge:
In short, we have worked hard to do the right thing, for all users, as these practices apply to all geographies, not just Europe.
In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.
In the case of a transfer to a data importer acting as a processor or sub-processor, specific requirements should apply in accordance with Article 28(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The standard contractual clauses should require the data importer to make available all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in the clauses and to allow for and contribute to audits of its processing activities by the data exporter. With respect to the engagement of any sub-processor by the data importer, in line with Article 28(2) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the standard contractual clauses should in particular set out the procedure for general or specific authorisation from the data exporter and the requirement for a written contract with the sub-processor ensuring the same level of protection as under the clauses.
In the case of organization accounts, we can provide the name(s) and email address(es) of the account owner(s) as well as the date and IP address at the time of creation of the organization account. We will not produce information about other members or contributors, if any, to the organization account or any additional information regarding the identified account owner(s) without a follow-up request for those specific users.
In the event of a contradiction between these Clauses and the provisions of related agreements between the Parties, existing at the time these Clauses are agreed or entered into thereafter, these Clauses shall prevail.
In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.
In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify, without undue delay, the data exporter and, where appropriate and feasible, the controller after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.
In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).
In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority \[for Module Three: and the controller\] of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.
In these guidelines, we provide a little background about what GitHub is, the types of data we have, and the conditions under which we will disclose private user information. Before we get into the details, however, here are a few important details you may want to know:

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.
It is appropriate to provide different safeguards in the standard contractual clauses that cover the specific situation of a transfer of personal data by a processor in the Union to its controller in a third country and reflect the limited self-standing obligations for processors under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In particular, the standard contractual clauses should require the processor to inform the controller if it is unable to follow its instructions, including if such instructions infringe Union data protection law, and require the controller to refrain from any actions that would prevent the processor from fulfilling its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. They should also require the parties to assist each other in responding to enquiries and requests from data subjects under the local law applicable to the data importer or, for data processing in the Union, under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Additional requirements to address any effects of the laws of the third country of destination on the controller’s compliance with the clauses, in particular how to deal with binding requests from public authorities in the third country for disclosure of the transferred personal data, should apply where the Union processor combines the personal data received from the controller in the third country with personal data collected by the processor in the Union. Conversely, no such requirements are justified where the outsourcing merely involves the processing and transfer back of personal data that has been received from the controller and in any event has been and will remain subject to the jurisdiction of the third country in question.
It is our policy to disclose non-public user information in connection with a civil or criminal investigation only with user consent or upon receipt of a valid subpoena, civil investigative demand, court order, search warrant, or other similar valid legal process. In certain exigent circumstances (see below), we also may share limited information but only corresponding to the nature of the circumstances, and would require legal process for anything beyond that. GitHub reserves the right to object to any requests for non-public information. Where GitHub agrees to produce non-public information in response to a lawful request, we will conduct a reasonable search for the requested information. Here are the kinds of information we will agree to produce, depending on the kind of legal process we are served with:
It is our policy to notify users about any pending requests regarding their accounts or repositories, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so. Before disclosing user information, we will make a reasonable effort to notify any affected account owner(s) by sending a message to their verified email address providing them with a copy of the subpoena, court order, or warrant so that they can have an opportunity to challenge the legal process if they wish. In (rare) exigent circumstances, we may delay notification if we determine delay is necessary to prevent death or serious harm or due to an ongoing investigation.
It is part of the InstantSearch family which is designed for different platforms:
It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.
It must be possible to clearly distinguish the information applicable to each transfer or category of transfers and, in this regard, to determine the respective role(s) of the Parties as data exporter(s) and/or data importer(s). This does not necessarily require completing and signing separate appendices for each transfer/category of transfers and/or contractual relationship, where this transparency can achieved through one appendix. However, where necessary to ensure sufficient clarity, separate appendices should be used.

Nathan Willis, writing for [LWN.net](/wiki/LWN.net "LWN.net"), describes the green, yellow, and red sliders of the Privacy Badger menu as being a "nice visualization aid", making it easy for the user to toggle the trackers on and off, if desired – describing it as much easier to browse through than [ad blocking](/wiki/Ad_blocking "Ad blocking") add-on interfaces.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)

Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data exporter or the data importer (or its sub-processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses. This is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.

OPTION 1: SPECIFIC PRIOR AUTHORISATION The data importer shall not sub-contract any of its processing activities performed on behalf of the data exporter under these Clauses to a sub-processor without the data exporter’s prior specific written authorisation. The data importer shall submit the request for specific authorisation at least \[Specify time period\] prior to the engagement of the sub-processor, together with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to decide on the authorisation. The list of sub-processors already authorised by the data exporter can be found in Annex III. The Parties shall keep Annex III up to date.

On April 3, 2015, Hill transferred the uBlock project to Chris Aljoudi due to frustrations with dealing with requests as the project's popularity increased.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18) "These projects are to me, not a full time job. It stopped being a hobby when it felt more and more like a tedious job. I will keep maintaining my version (and share with whoever care to use it) because it guarantees the tool will match what I want out of it."[\[19\]](#cite_note-19) Hill created his own fork and renamed it uBlock Origin on April 6.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20)
On April 3, 2015, Microsoft announced that starting with [Windows 10](/wiki/Windows_10 "Windows 10"), it would comply with the specification and no longer automatically enable Do Not Track as part of the operating system's "Express" default settings, but that the company will "provide customers with clear information on how to turn this feature on in the browser settings should they wish to do so".[\[24\]](#cite_note-cw-dntdisabledms-24)
On August 24, 2022, the California Attorney General announced [Sephora](/wiki/Sephora "Sephora") paid a $1.2-million settlement for allegedly failing to process opt-out requests via a user-enabled global privacy control signal.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
On December 11, 2016, Nik Rolls released a [fork](/wiki/Fork_\(software_development\) "Fork (software development)") of uBlock Origin for the Microsoft Edge browser (now known as [Microsoft Edge Legacy](/wiki/Microsoft_Edge#Edge_Legacy_\(2014–2019\) "Microsoft Edge")).[\[34\]](#cite_note-microsoftedge-34) In April 2020, this fork was deprecated as Microsoft replaced Microsoft Edge Legacy with a Chromium-based Edge.[\[35\]](#cite_note-:2-35)
On September 7, 2012, [Roy Fielding](/wiki/Roy_Fielding "Roy Fielding"), an author of the Do Not Track standard, [committed](/wiki/Commit_\(version_control\) "Commit (version control)") a patch to the source code of the [Apache HTTP Server](/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server "Apache HTTP Server"), which would make the server explicitly ignore any use of the Do Not Track header by users of Internet Explorer 10. Fielding wrote that Microsoft's decision "deliberately violates" the Do Not Track specification because it "does not protect anyone's privacy unless the recipients believe it was set by a real human being, with a real preference for privacy over personalization". The Do Not Track specification did not explicitly mandate that the use of Do Not Track actually be a choice until after the feature was implemented in Internet Explorer 10.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20) According to Fielding, Microsoft knew its Do Not Track signals would be ignored, and that its goal was to effectively give an illusion of privacy while still catering to their own interests.[\[21\]](#cite_note-cnet-apachednt-21) On October 9, 2012, Fielding's patch was [commented out](/wiki/Comment_\(computer_programming\) "Comment (computer programming)"), restoring the previous behavior.[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)
On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data subject free of charge.

One question we expect people to ask is to see the data we collect. However, we don't have a reliable way to do this as VS Code does not have a 'sign-in' experience that would uniquely identify a user. We do send information that helps us approximate a single user for diagnostic purposes (this is based on a hash of the network adapter NIC on the desktop and a randomly assigned UUID on the web) but this is not guaranteed to be unique. For example, virtual machines (VMs) often rotate NIC IDs or allocate from a pool. This technique is sufficient to help us when working through problems, but it is not reliable enough for us to 'provide your data'.
One week later, Microsoft announced that its next browser would include support for Tracking Protection Lists that block tracking of consumers using blacklists supplied by third parties.[\[6\]](#cite_note-6) In January 2011, Mozilla announced that its Firefox browser would soon provide a Do Not Track solution, via a browser header.[\[7\]](#cite_note-online-7) Microsoft's [Internet Explorer 9](/wiki/Internet_Explorer_9 "Internet Explorer 9"),[\[8\]](#cite_note-8) Apple's Safari,[\[9\]](#cite_note-Nick_Wingfield-9) Opera[\[10\]](#cite_note-Opera-10) and Google Chrome[\[11\]](#cite_note-longerbattery-11) all later added support for the header approach.

Privacy Badger belongs to a class of free tracker blockers which function as web browser plugins.[\[16\]](#cite_note-:0-16): B1  Tracker blockers similar to Privacy Badger include [Disconnect](/wiki/Disconnect_Mobile "Disconnect Mobile"), [uBlock Origin](/wiki/UBlock_Origin "UBlock Origin"), Redmorph and [Ghostery](/wiki/Ghostery "Ghostery").[\[16\]](#cite_note-:0-16): B1 [\[17\]](#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](#cite_note-18) Privacy Badger has also been compared favorably to [Blur](/wiki/Blur_\(software\) "Blur (software)"), which has an annual subscription fee.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)
Privacy Badger has been noted as one recommended tool in a set of tools to protect online privacy.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)
Processes for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures in order to ensure the security of the processing
Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the controller and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).

Purpose and scope
Purpose(s) of the data transfer and further processing
Pursuant to Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in the absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission pursuant to Article 45(3), a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country only if it has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. Such safeguards may be provided for by standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission pursuant to Article 46(2)(c).
Pursuant to Article 46(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Decision 2001/497/EC and Decision 2010/87/EU remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by a Commission decision adopted pursuant to Article 46(2) of that Regulation. The standard contractual clauses in the decisions required updating in the light of new requirements in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Moreover, since the decisions were adopted, the digital economy has seen significant developments, with the widespread use of new and more complex processing operations often involving multiple data importers and exporters, long and complex processing chains, and evolving business relationships. This calls for modernisation of the standard contractual clauses to reflect those realities better, by covering additional processing and transfer situations, and to allow a more flexible approach, for example with respect to the number of parties able to join the contract.

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.
Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see "[Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)."

Since October 2017, uBlock Origin has been completely separated from Aljoudi's uBlock.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21) Aljoudi created ublock.org to host and promote uBlock and to request donations. In response, uBlock's founder Raymond Hill stated that "the donations sought by ublock.org are not benefiting any of those who contributed most to create uBlock Origin."[\[6\]](#cite_note-gorhill_readme-6) The development of uBlock stopped in August 2015 but there were sporadic updates from January 2017.[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)

Technological developments are facilitating cross-border data flows necessary for the expansion of international cooperation and international trade. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is not undermined where personal data is transferred to third countries, including in cases of onward transfers [(2)](#ntr2-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0002). The data transfer provisions in Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are intended to ensure the continuity of that high level of protection where personal data is transferred to a third country [(3)](#ntr3-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0003).
Technology websites and user reviews for uBlock Origin have regarded the extension as less resource-intensive than extensions that provide similar feature sets such as Adblock Plus.[\[43\]](#cite_note-lynch_firefox-43)[\[44\]](#cite_note-44)[\[45\]](#cite_note-45) A [benchmark test](/wiki/Benchmark_\(computing\) "Benchmark (computing)"), conducted in August 2015 with ten blocking extensions, showed uBlock Origin as the most resource-efficient among the extensions tested.[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)

Thank you for using GitHub! We're happy you're here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using GitHub. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible.

The AdChoices icon is there to inform you that data is being collected or used for interest-based advertising on your device by a company.
The AdChoices program is consistent with the requirements set out in Canadian privacy laws.
The Appendix to these Clauses containing the Annexes referred to therein forms an integral part of these Clauses.

The Collimated Beam Projector (CBP) is a Commandable SAL Component that provides horizontal and vertical axis control of an integrating sphere in conjunction with a projecting light source for calibrating the Main Telescope.
The Commission shall evaluate the practical application of the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex on the basis of all available information, as part of the periodic evaluation required by Article 97 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
The Composable Platform, Created for Builders
The DNT header accepts three values: `1` in case the user does not want to be tracked _(opt-out)_, `0` in case the user consents to be tracked _(opt-in)_, or _null_ (no header sent) if the user has not expressed a preference. The default behavior required by the standard is not to send the header unless the user enables the setting via their browser or their choice is implied by the use of that specific browser.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)
The Do Not Track header was originally proposed in 2009 by researchers Christopher Soghoian, Sid Stamm, and Dan Kaminsky. Mozilla Firefox became the first browser to implement the feature.
The EFF states: "If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser. To the advertiser, it's like you suddenly disappeared."[\[6\]](#cite_note-How_it_works-6) Privacy Badger works by detecting the presence of content loaded from third-party domains when you visit a website, then blocking those domains which are determined to be tracking you.[\[7\]](#cite_note-:02-7): B4  Controls on the software allow selective blocking of the third-party domains based on user preference.[\[7\]](#cite_note-:02-7): B4  Unlike adblockers, Privacy Badger only blocks those ads which come with embedded trackers.[\[4\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-4)
The European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board were consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered a joint opinion on 14 January 2021 [(12)](#ntr12-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0012), which has been taken into consideration in the preparation of this Decision.
The GPC signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request from a global privacy control, as per [CCPA-REGULATIONS §999.315](https://www.oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/oal-sub-final-text-of-regs.pdf) for that browser or device, or, if known, the consumer. Under the GDPR, the intent of the GPC signal is to convey a general request that data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user’s personal data to other data controllers ([GDPR Articles 7 & 21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679)). Over time, the GPC signal may be intended to communicate rights in other jurisdictions.
The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference documentation are available [here](https://global-privacy-control.glitch.me/). For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter ([@globablprivctrl](https://twitter.com/globalprivctrl)).
The GPC was initially spearheaded by [Ashkan Soltani](https://twitter.com/ashk4n) [Georgetown Law](https://www.georgetowntech.org/) and [Sebastian Zimmeck](https://twitter.com/SZimmeck) ([Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/)) in collaboration with [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/), [Automattic (Wordpress.com & Tumblr)](https://automattic.com/), [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), [DuckDuckGo](https://spreadprivacy.com/announcing-global-privacy-control/), [Brave](https://brave.com/global-privacy-control/), [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/), [Abine](https://joindeleteme.com/blog/how-to-enable-global-privacy-control/), [Digital Content Next (DCN)](https://digitalcontentnext.org/), [Consumer Reports](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/issue/tech-privacy/), and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/).

The parties should be able to demonstrate compliance with the standard contractual clauses. In particular, the data importer should be required to keep appropriate documentation for the processing activities under its responsibility and to inform the data exporter promptly if it is unable to comply with the clauses, for whatever reason. In turn, the data exporter should suspend the transfer and, in particularly serious cases, have the right to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under standard contractual clauses, where the data importer is in breach of the clauses or unable to comply with them. Specific rules should apply where local laws affect compliance with the clauses. Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract, and any copies thereof, should at the choice of the data exporter be returned to the data exporter or destroyed in their entirety.
The parties should take account, in particular, of the specific circumstances of the transfer (such as the content and duration of the contract, the nature of the data to be transferred, the type of recipient, the purpose of the processing), the laws and practices of the third country of destination that are relevant in light of the circumstances of the transfer and any safeguards put in place to supplement those under the standard contractual clauses (including relevant contractual, technical and organisational measures applying to the transmission of personal data and its processing in the country of destination). As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with the standard contractual clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment, including reliable information on the application of the law in practice (such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies), the existence or absence of requests in the same sector and, under strict conditions, the documented practical experience of the data exporter and/or data importer.

The purpose of these standard contractual clauses is to ensure compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) [(1)](#ntr1-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0001) for the transfer of personal data to a third country.
The role of standard contractual clauses is limited to ensuring appropriate data protection safeguards for international data transfers. Therefore, the controller or processor transferring the personal data to a third country (the ‘data exporter’) and the controller or processor receiving the personal data (the ‘data importer’) are free to include those standard contractual clauses in a wider contract and to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects. Controllers and processors are encouraged to provide additional safeguards by means of contractual commitments that supplement the standard contractual clauses [(4)](#ntr4-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0004). The use of the standard contractual clauses is without prejudice to any contractual obligations of the data exporter and/or importer to ensure respect for applicable privileges and immunities.
The root component to start using React InstantSearch is the [`<InstantSearch>`](/doc/api-reference/widgets/instantsearch/react/) provider. This component connects your InstantSearch app to your Algolia application. It accepts a search client and the index to search into.
The root provider component of all widgets and Hooks.
The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.
The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see "[About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github)" and "[Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github)."

The signal has been implemented by DuckDuckGo's privacy extension, _The New York Times_, and privacy browser Brave and is supported by Firefox creator, Mozilla as well as former California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. GPC is a spiritual successor to the Do Not Track header that was created in 2009 but didn't find widespread success due to the lack of legislation that would require companies to legally respect the Do Not Track header.

The standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision combine general clauses with a modular approach to cater for various transfer scenarios and the complexity of modern processing chains. In addition to the general clauses, controllers and processors should select the module applicable to their situation, so as to tailor their obligations under the standard contractual clauses to their role and responsibilities in relation to the data processing in question. It should be possible for more than two parties to adhere to the standard contractual clauses. Moreover, additional controllers and processors should be allowed to accede to the standard contractual clauses as data exporters or importers throughout the lifecycle of the contract of which they form a part.
The standard contractual clauses should provide for rules on liability between the parties and with respect to data subjects, and rules on indemnification between the parties. Where the data subject suffers material or non-material damage as a consequence of any breach of the third-party beneficiary rights under the standard contractual clauses, he or she should be entitled to compensation. This should be without prejudice to any liability under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
The standard contractual clauses should provide for specific safeguards, in particular in the light of the case law of the Court of Justice [(11)](#ntr11-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0011), to address any effects of the laws of the third country of destination on the data importer’s compliance with the clauses, in particular how to deal with binding requests from public authorities in that country for disclosure of the transferred personal data.
The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:
The technical and organisational measures must be described in specific (and not generic) terms. See also the general comment on the first page of the Appendix, in particular on the need to clearly indicate which measures apply to each transfer/set of transfers.
The term delegate refers to the 900 data rights holders who have accounts in the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) and access to the DP0 data sets. Use the [getting started with DP0 checklist](https://dp0.lsst.io/delegate-resources/getting-started.html#new-delegate-checklist) to become a delegate and have access to the DP0 data sets.
The transfer and processing of personal data under standard contractual clauses should not take place if the laws and practices of the third country of destination prevent the data importer from complying with the clauses. In this context, laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should not be considered as being in conflict with the standard contractual clauses. The parties should warrant that, at the time of agreeing to the standard contractual clauses, they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices applicable to the data importer are not in line with these requirements.

Then, **install `algoliasearch` and `react-instantsearch`** following the [installation guide](/doc/guides/building-search-ui/installation/react/).
Then, import the library in your React application.
There are multiple wrappers for popular frameworks, such as [React InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/react/?utm_source=instantsearch.js&utm_campaign=repository "React InstantSearch documentation"), [Vue InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/vue/?utm_source=instantsearch.js&utm_campaign=repository "Vue InstantSearch documentation"), and [Angular InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/angular/?utm_source=instantsearch.js&utm_campaign=repository "Angular InstantSearch documentation").
These Clauses apply with respect to the transfer of personal data as specified in Annex I.B.
These Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to which the data exporter is subject by virtue of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
These Clauses set out appropriate safeguards, including enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies, pursuant to Article 46(1) and Article 46(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, with respect to data transfers from controllers to processors and/or processors to processors, standard contractual clauses pursuant to Article 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided they are not modified, except to select the appropriate Module(s) or to add or update information in the Appendix. This does not prevent the Parties from including the standard contractual clauses laid down in these Clauses in a wider contract and/or to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, these Clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects.
These Clauses shall be governed by the law of a country allowing for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (specify country).
These Clauses shall be read and interpreted in the light of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that conflicts with rights and obligations provided for in Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Please be aware that we do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law. California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing (privacy\[at\]github\[dot\]com). Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated email address.
Under state and federal law, GitHub can seek reimbursement for costs associated with compliance with a valid legal demand, such as a subpoena, court order or search warrant. We only charge to recover some costs, and these reimbursements cover only a portion of the costs we actually incur to comply with legal orders.

Usage Data
Use AI to identify and boost popular content to stay on top of what’s trending - whether that’s driven by world events or what's hot at the moment.
Use behavioral cues and context to suggest relevant items to users at any point in their journey. Improve their engagement rates and conversion/cart metrics.
Use integrations and pre-built libraries to build scalable search experiences.
Use of [ad blocking](/wiki/Ad_blocking "Ad blocking") software to block web trackers and advertising has become increasingly common (with users citing both privacy concerns and performance impact as justification), while Apple and Mozilla began to add privacy enhancements (such as "tracking protection") to their browsers, that are designed to reduce undue cross-site tracking. In addition, laws such as the European Union's [General Data Protection Regulation](/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation "General Data Protection Regulation") (GDPR) have imposed restrictions on how companies are to store and process personal information.[\[27\]](#cite_note-gizmodo-doesntdoanything-27)[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)
Use of sub-processors
Use our API clients, frameworks and integrations to push your data.
Use our extensive library of open source front-end components to create your own UIs and automatically ingest events. We have you covered with filters, sorting, pagination and maps.
Use quotation marks to search for an "exact phrase". Append an asterisk (\*) to a search term to find variations of it (transp\*, 32019R\*). Use a question mark (?) instead of a single character in your search term to find variations of it (ca?e finds case, cane, care).

VS Code and this page refer to three different types of data with respect to telemetry.
VS Code collects telemetry about which extensions are being activated for what file types and what workspaces/folders. Specific folders are identified by computing a hash of each of the folder's Git remotes.
VS Code lets you add features to the product by installing Microsoft and third-party extensions. These extensions may be collecting their own usage data and are not controlled by the `telemetry.telemetryLevel` setting. Consult the specific extension's documentation to learn about its telemetry reporting and whether it can be disabled.
VS Code provides extension recommendations based on your file types, your workspace, and your environment. File type recommendations are either precomputed or dynamic. Workspace and environment recommendations are always precomputed.

Very few advertising companies actually supported DNT, due to a lack of regulatory or voluntary requirements for its use,[\[25\]](#cite_note-bi-gapingflaw-25) and unclear standards over how websites should respond to the header. Websites that honor DNT requests include [Medium](/wiki/Medium_\(website\) "Medium (website)") and [Pinterest](/wiki/Pinterest "Pinterest").[\[26\]](#cite_note-26) Despite offering the option in its Chrome web browser, [Google](/wiki/Google "Google") did not implement support for DNT on its websites, and directed users to its online privacy settings and opt-outs for interest-based advertising instead.[\[27\]](#cite_note-gizmodo-doesntdoanything-27) The [Digital Advertising Alliance](/wiki/Digital_Advertising_Alliance "Digital Advertising Alliance"), [Council of Better Business Bureaus](/wiki/Council_of_Better_Business_Bureaus "Council of Better Business Bureaus") and the [Direct Marketing Association](/wiki/Direct_Marketing_Association "Direct Marketing Association") does not require its members to honor DNT signals.[\[28\]](#cite_note-DAA-position-28)

Visual Studio Code collects telemetry data, which is used to help understand how to improve the product. For example, this usage data helps to debug issues, such as slow start-up times, and to prioritize new features. While we appreciate the insights this data provides, we also know that not everyone wants to send usage data and you can disable telemetry as described in [disable telemetry reporting](#_disable-telemetry-reporting). You can also read our [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=528096&clcid=0x409) to learn more.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Welcome to GitHub! Let's begin the adventure
Welcome to the GitHub Privacy Statement. This is where we describe how we handle your “Personal Data”, which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that GitHub, Inc. or GitHub B.V., processes as the “Data Controller” when you interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement (collectively, “Services”). This Statement does not apply to services or products that do not display this Statement, such as Previews, where relevant.
We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

When Algolia returns new results, you want to list them in the UI. You can use the [`<Hits>`](/doc/api-reference/widgets/hits/react/) widget.
When a school or employer supplies your GitHub account, they assume the role of Data Controller for most Personal Data used in our Services. This enables them to:
When carrying out these activities, GitHub practices data minimization and uses the minimum amount of Personal Information required.
When tracing telemetry events, the events are also logged to a local file `telemetry.log`, which you can view using the **Developer: Open Log File...** command and choosing **Telemetry** from the dropdown.
When using the "Express" settings upon installation, a Do Not Track option is enabled by default for [Internet Explorer 10](/wiki/Internet_Explorer_10 "Internet Explorer 10") and [Windows 8](/wiki/Windows_8 "Windows 8").[\[16\]](#cite_note-16) Microsoft faced criticism for its decision to enable Do Not Track by default[\[17\]](#cite_note-17) from advertising companies, who say that use of the Do Not Track header should be a choice made by the user and must not be automatically enabled. The companies also said that this decision would violate the [Digital Advertising Alliance](/wiki/Digital_Advertising_Alliance "Digital Advertising Alliance")'s agreement with the U.S. government to honor a Do Not Track system, because the coalition said it would only honor such a system if it were not enabled by default by web browsers.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18) A Microsoft spokesperson defended its decision however, stating that users would prefer a web browser that automatically respected their privacy.[\[19\]](#cite_note-dig-msdnt-19)
When you open a file type for which VS Code does not have any precomputed recommendation, it asks the Extension Marketplace for extensions that declare that they support this file type. If the query returns extensions you don't have installed, VS Code will provide a notification.
When you see the blue triangular icon in ads or on websites and apps, it is meant to alert and inform you that interest-based advertising data is being collected or used on that device.
When you use **Developer: Toggle Developer Tools** or **Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools**, VS Code may talk to Google servers to fetch data needed to launch Developer Tools.
When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.
Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.
Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.
Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.
Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.). \[For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the information to the controller.\]
Where possible, the data importer should notify the data exporter and the data subject if it receives a legally binding request from a public (including judicial) authority under the law of the country of destination for disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to the standard contractual clauses. Similarly, it should notify them if it becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to such personal data, in accordance with the law of the third country of destination. If, despite its best efforts, the data importer is not in a position to notify the data exporter and/or the data subject of specific disclosure requests, it should provide the data exporter with as much relevant information as possible on the requests. In addition, the data importer should provide the data exporter with aggregate information at regular intervals. The data importer should also be required to document any request for disclosure received and the response provided, and make that information available to the data exporter or the competent supervisory authority, or both, upon request. If, following a review of the legality of such a request under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the third country of destination, it should challenge it, including, where appropriate, by exhausting available possibilities of appeal. In any event, if the data importer is no longer able to comply with the standard contractual clauses, it should inform the data exporter accordingly, including where this is the consequence of a request for disclosure.
Where requests from a data subject are excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the data importer may either charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of granting the request or refuse to act on the request.
Where the audit is carried out on the instructions of the controller, the data exporter shall make the results available to the controller.
Where the competent Member State authorities exercise corrective powers pursuant to Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in response to the data importer being or becoming subject to laws or practices in the third country of destination that prevent it from complying with the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex, leading to the suspension or ban of data transfers to third countries, the Member State concerned shall, without delay, inform the Commission, which will forward the information to the other Member States.
Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the controller), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. [(9)](#ntr9-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0009) The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.
Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. [(8)](#ntr8-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0008) The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.
Where the data importer processes the personal data for direct marketing purposes, it shall cease processing for such purposes if the data subject objects to it.
Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to:
Where the processing involves data transfers from controllers subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to processors outside its territorial scope or from processors subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to sub-processors outside its territorial scope, the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision should also allow to fulfil the requirements of Article 28(3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards set out in Annex I.B.
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards adapted to the specific nature of the data and the risks involved. This may include restricting the personnel permitted to access the personal data, additional security measures (such as pseudonymisation) and/or additional restrictions with respect to further disclosure.
Where these Clauses use terms that are defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, those terms shall have the same meaning as in that Regulation.

Whether you’re scaling your startup or just learning how to code, GitHub is your home. Join the world’s largest developer platform to build the innovations that empower humanity. Let’s build from here.
While the overwhelming majority of our users use GitHub's services to create new businesses, build new technologies, and for the general betterment of humankind, we recognize that with millions of users spread all over the world, there are bound to be a few bad apples in the bunch. In those cases, we want to help law enforcement serve their legitimate interest in protecting the public.
While we do not charge in emergency situations or in other exigent circumstances, we seek reimbursement for all other legal requests in accordance with the following schedule, unless otherwise required by law:
Wikimedia Commons has media related to [UBlock](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:UBlock "commons:Category:UBlock").
With 17,000+ customers in more than 150 countries and a platform built for fast deployment and ease of use, Algolia was also recognized for its "Ability to execute". Get your complimentary copy of the report to learn more about the criteria used to evaluate the many different search providers.

With some exceptions, in particular as regards certain obligations that exclusively concern the relationship between the data exporter and data importer, data subjects should be able to invoke, and where necessary enforce, the standard contractual clauses as third-party beneficiaries. Therefore, while the parties should be allowed to choose the law of one of the Member States as governing the standard contractual clauses, that law must allow for third-party beneficiary rights. In order to facilitate individual redress, the standard contractual clauses should require the data importer to inform data subjects of a contact point and to deal promptly with any complaints or requests. In the event of a dispute between the data importer and a data subject who invokes his or her rights as a third-party beneficiary, the data subject should be able to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority or refer the dispute to the competent courts in the EU.
With the `telemetry.telemetryLevel` user [setting](/docs/getstarted/settings), you can control the different types of telemetry we send with a single setting. Here is a table of the different types of data sent with each value of `telemetry.telemetryLevel`:

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.
You can find links for all editions of this documentation by visiting [https://pipelines.lsst.io/v](https://pipelines.lsst.io/v).
You can find more information about how the Visual Studio family approaches GDPR at [Visual Studio Family Data Subject Requests for the GDPR](https://learn.microsoft.com/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-dsr-visual-studio-family).
You can improve this documentation by sending a pull request or creating an issue. See the [Contributing](https://rsp.lsst.io/contributing/index.html) section of the docs for details.
You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see "[Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)."
You can now test performing transformations on your source data before storing it in the destination.
You can pass any [search parameters](/doc/api-reference/search-api-parameters/) to [`<Configure>`](/doc/api-reference/widgets/configure/react/), even reactive props coming from the React state but **you shouldn’t overuse [`<Configure>`](/doc/api-reference/widgets/configure/react/).** If you need to set a search parameter after a user interaction, you may want to use a [refinement widget](#filter-with-a-refinement-list).
You can render the `<Configure>` widget in your app, specifying 40 hits per page.
You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.
You can use any [Hook and widget](/doc/api-reference/widgets/react/) in [`<InstantSearch>`](/doc/api-reference/widgets/instantsearch/react/).
You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:
You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.
You can use the [`<Pagination>`](/doc/api-reference/widgets/pagination/react/) widget to navigate through all the pages.

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.
You may have noticed “Do Not Sell” and “Object To Processing” links around the web from companies complying with privacy regulations. To opt out of websites selling or sharing your personal information, you need to click these links for every site you visit.
You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.
You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.
You may notice that it’s hard to understand why a hit is ranked higher than others. To improve this experience, **you can highlight the parts of a result that matched the query.**
You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.
You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.You now have a good starting point to create an even more dynamic experience with React InstantSearch. Next up, you could improve this app by:
You own the content you post on GitHub. However, you have some responsibilities regarding it, and we ask you to grant us some rights so we can provide services to you.
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution.

[(1)](#ntc1-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0001)   [OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1](./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC).
[(1)](#ntc1-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0001)  Where the data exporter is a processor subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 acting on behalf of a Union institution or body as controller, reliance on these Clauses when engaging another processor (sub-processing) not subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also ensures compliance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC ([OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39](./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC)), to the extent these Clauses and the data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 29(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are aligned. This will in particular be the case where the controller and processor rely on the standard contractual clauses included in Decision 2021/915.
[(10)](#ntc10-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0010)   Schrems II, paragraphs 96 and 103. See also Regulation (EU) 2016/679, recitals 108 and 114.
[(10)](#ntc10-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0010)  That period may be extended by a maximum of two more months, to the extent necessary taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The data importer shall duly and promptly inform the data subject of any such extension.
[(11)](#ntc11-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0011)   Schrems II.
[(11)](#ntc11-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0011)  The data importer may offer independent dispute resolution through an arbitration body only if it is established in a country that has ratified the New York Convention on Enforcement of Arbitration Awards.
[(12)](#ntc12-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0012)  EDPB EDPS Joint Opinion 2/2021 on the European Commission’s Implementing Decision on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries for the matters referred to in Article 46(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
[(12)](#ntc12-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0012)  As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies.
[(2)](#ntc2-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0002)  Article 44 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
[(2)](#ntc2-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0002)  This requires rendering the data anonymous in such a way that the individual is no longer identifiable by anyone, in line with recital 26 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and that this process is irreversible.
[(3)](#ntc3-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0003)  See also judgment of the Court of Justice of 16 July 2020 in Case C-311/18, Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Ltd and Maximillian Schrems (‘Schrems II’), ECLI:EU:C:2020:559, paragraph 93.
[(3)](#ntc3-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0003)  The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.
[(4)](#ntc4-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0004)  Recital 109 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
[(4)](#ntc4-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0004)  The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.
[(5)](#ntc5-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0005)  Commission Decision 2001/497/EC of 15 June 2001 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries, under Directive 95/46/EC ([OJ L 181, 4.7.2001, p. 19](./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2001:181:TOC)).
[(5)](#ntc5-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0005)  See Article 28(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, where the controller is an EU institution or body, Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.
[(6)](#ntc6-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0006)  Commission Decision 2010/87/EU of 5 February 2010 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries under Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ([OJ L 39, 12.2.2010, p. 5](./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2010:039:TOC)).
[(6)](#ntc6-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0006)  The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

[(7)](#ntc7-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0007)  Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ([OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31](./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1995:281:TOC)).
[(7)](#ntc7-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0007)  This includes whether the transfer and further processing involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences.
[(8)](#ntc8-L_2021199EN.01003101-E0008)  Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC ([OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39](./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC)); see recital 5.

\* What this is doing is creating a dummy element ("reflection") inside a detached phantom node ("mirror")
\* element instead, this would conflict with element types which use indexed properties (such as forms and
\* select lists).
\* that serves as the target of Object.defineProperty instead. While we could simply use the subject HTML

\[1\] “Search” means the full text content is searchable from the Advanced search page.
\[2\] “Browse” means the entity is linked from a page on this portal.\[Examples of possible measures:
\[For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the notification to the controller.\]
\[For Modules One, Two and Three: Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data.\] \[For Module Four: Personal data collected by the data exporter in the EU that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall immediately be deleted in its entirety, including any copy thereof.\] The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.
\[OPTION 1: These Clauses shall be governed by the law of one of the EU Member States, provided such law allows for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (specify Member State).\]
\[OPTION 2 (for Modules Two and Three): These Clauses shall be governed by the law of the EU Member State in which the data exporter is established. Where such law does not allow for third-party beneficiary rights, they shall be governed by the law of another EU Member State that does allow for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (specify Member State).\]
\[OPTION: The data importer agrees that data subjects may also lodge a complaint with an independent dispute resolution body [(11)](#ntr11-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0011) at no cost to the data subject. It shall inform the data subjects, in the manner set out in paragraph (a), of such redress mechanism and that they are not required to use it, or follow a particular sequence in seeking redress.\]
\[Where the data exporter is established in an EU Member State:\] The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.
\[Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:\] The supervisory authority of the Member State in which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.
\[Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:\] The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.

uBlock Origin remains independent and does not allow ads for payment.[\[27\]](#cite_note-27) The project refuses donations and instead advises supporters to donate to maintainers of block lists.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28) Hill continued to work on the extension under the name uBlock Origin, abbreviated as uBO[\[29\]](#cite_note-29) and originally as uBlock0.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
uBlock Origin supports the majority of [Adblock Plus](/wiki/Adblock_Plus "Adblock Plus")'s [filter syntax](/wiki/Adblock_Plus#Filters "Adblock Plus"). The popular filter lists [EasyList](/wiki/Easylist "Easylist") and EasyPrivacy are enabled by default. The extensions are capable of importing [hosts files](/wiki/Hosts_\(file\) "Hosts (file)") and a number of community-maintained lists are available at installation. Among the host files available, Peter Lowe's ad servers & tracking list and lists of malware domains are also enabled as default. Some additional features include dynamic filtering of scripts and [iframes](/wiki/HTML_element#Frames "HTML element") and a tool for webpage element hiding.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]
uBlock Origin surveys what style resources are required for an individual [web page](/wiki/Web_page "Web page") rather than relying on a universal [style sheet](/wiki/Style_sheet_\(web_development\) "Style sheet (web development)"). The extension takes a [snapshot](/wiki/Snapshot_\(computer_storage\) "Snapshot (computer storage)") of the filters the user has enabled, which contributes to accelerated browser start-up speed when compared to retrieving filters from cache every time.[\[47\]](#cite_note-47)
uBlock was initially named "μBlock" but the name was later changed to "uBlock" to avoid confusion as to how the Greek letter [μ](/wiki/%CE%9C "Μ") (Mu/Micro) in "μBlock" should be pronounced.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Development started by [forking](/wiki/Fork_\(software_development\) "Fork (software development)") from the [codebase](/wiki/Codebase "Codebase") of [HTTP Switchboard](/wiki/HTTP_Switchboard "HTTP Switchboard") along with another blocking extension called uMatrix, designed for advanced users.[\[13\]](#cite_note-13) uBlock was developed by Raymond Hill to use community-maintained [block lists](/wiki/Blacklist_\(computing\) "Blacklist (computing)"),[\[14\]](#cite_note-brinkmann_chrome-14) while adding features and raising the [code quality](/wiki/Software_quality "Software quality") to [release](/wiki/Release_engineering "Release engineering") standards.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15) First released in June 2014 as a Chrome and Opera [extension](/wiki/Browser_extension "Browser extension"), in 2015 the extension became available in other browsers.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
where necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
where none of the other conditions apply, the data importer has obtained the explicit consent of the data subject for an onward transfer in a specific situation, after having informed him/her of its purpose(s), the identity of the recipient and the possible risks of such transfer to him/her due to the lack of appropriate data protection safeguards. In this case, the data importer shall inform the data exporter and, at the request of the latter, shall transmit to it a copy of the information provided to the data subject.
