AI search that understands your users
-------------------------------------

Say hello to the search API that understands your customers as well as you do. Now anyone can add AI-powered search to their site or app in minutes to deliver a better experience for their customers. 

#### NeuralSearch: semantic plus keyword search

Our approach combines semantic search with keyword search. So your customers can find precisely what they’re looking for in milliseconds — while you surface under-exposed content.

#### Query Categorization

A query can relate to more than one category. So “tomato” might mean a sauce or fresh produce and “Burgundy” could be a region, a wine, or a color. Our AI algorithms predict and show results from the the most likely category, improving relevance and boosting customer outcomes.

Algolia AI Search FAQs
----------------------

*   #### How are OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Algolia AI Search similar or different?
    
    Both solutions use large language models (LLMs) to provide results, but they solve very different problems. 
    
    *   ChatGPT is a generative model that predicts the next most likely word/s based on the input context and underlying training. 
    *   Algolia AI Search retrieves the best search results from your search index based on your clearly-defined business outcomes. 
    
    For example, in the context of ecommerce search, an AI chatbot can act like a virtual sales assistant to discuss what you’re looking for. With AI search, it’s as if the sales assistant is ranking the top items based on personalization, rules, merchandising, top performing results, past purchase or search history, or other factors you’ve identified as important.
    
*   #### How fast is Algolia AI Search?
    
    Really fast. Most of our search queries take from 1 to 20 milliseconds to process. That’s up to 200 times faster than our competitors.  
      
    That said, query performance depends on many factors, from the size of the data you’re searching through to how CPU-intensive a query is. For example, features like geo-sorting and distinct are more “expensive”.

*   #### What is a search index?
    
    An index is the place where the data used by a search engine is stored. An index is to search what a “table” is for a database. Unlike a database table, an index is optimized for search operations. For example, in an ecommerce website, the index would be a complete list of all products with a custom ranking.
    
    [Learn more here](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406981910289-What-is-an-index-).
    
*   #### Which languages are supported by Algolia AI Search?
    
    Our engine is language-agnostic: it supports [alphabet-based and symbol-based languages](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406975245073-Which-languages-are-supported-by-the-engine-) (such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean). 
    
    This is no easy feat, considering all the little and big differences languages have, from being based on symbols from different alphabets like Japanese or using many variants of the same stem like in German. So we added [advanced capabilities](https://www.algolia.com/blog/engineering/natural-languages-in-search/) to handle the specificities of such languages.
    
*   #### What content can Algolia AI Search search?
    
    Algolia AI Search can power search for any kind of content. Actually Algolia doesn’t directly search in your original data source, but in the data you submit, which Algolia hosts on its servers.
    
*   #### What is a search API?
    
    [Search APIs](https://www.algolia.com/blog/product/what-to-look-for-in-a-search-api/) are software components that allow developers to seamlessly introduce search capabilities to websites and applications. They provide backend tools for indexing documents, querying various types of data, managing cluster configurations, viewing search analytics, and more.
