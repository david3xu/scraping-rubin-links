What is  
Interest-Based Advertising?
=====================================

All advertising seeks to show the right products to the right audience at the right time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most online ads are not targeted to you as an individual but rather to data categories such as your probable demographics (age, gender), interests (automobiles, travel, shoes), location, websites visited and apps used.

**Why am I seeing that blue icon?**
===================================

When you see the blue triangular icon in ads or on websites and apps, it is meant to alert and inform you that interest-based advertising data is being collected or used on that device.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AdChoices represents a company’s promise that you can control your ad targeting experience with them. Click or tap on the icon to discover more.

**How Your  
Information is Used**
==================================

Serving online ads based on predicted interests relies on recognizing cookies stored by web browsers, advertising IDs set on mobile devices, or token identifiers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over time, this information gathered by companies informs them how to show more relevant ads. For example, people who visit automotive websites might receive more ads for a particular model of car that interests them.

The Icon and  
How It Works
===========================

The AdChoices icon is there to inform you that data is being collected or used for interest-based advertising on your device by a company.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AdChoices is not an advertising company itself. It is simply a notice that dozens of companies use to let you know that you can control the interest-based data flow companies use for ads by clicking or tapping on the blue icon to learn more or to opt out.

The AdChoices program is consistent with the requirements set out in Canadian privacy laws.

  
  

**The Icon is  
Your Beacon**
=============================

In Canada, you have privacy rights that companies need to adhere to - and that’s why you see the blue icon - it’s there to inform and empower you to take control.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advertising fuels the internet's economy. In order to use the services we have come to expect from the web, such as social media, free email accounts, websites we visit, apps we use and more, these services need to be funded.

Advertising, like many other forms of media, funds these platforms. When ad targeting is done right, it's relevant and timely.

Managing  
What You Share
=========================

Through the AdChoices self-regulatory program, you can opt out of interest-based advertising and report any issues with it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companies engaging in any type of interest-based advertising practices online should be respecting your data privacy rights in Canada by providing you with notice about the collection of data for advertising purposes and the use of interest-based advertising when it’s happening. Companies must also give you the ability to opt out.

**Report a Complaint**
======================

Companies registered in the AdChoices self-regulatory program are held accountable.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Canada, complaints are accepted and addressed through the independent enforcement body, Ad Standards.
