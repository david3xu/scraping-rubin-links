About the technical documentation portal
========================================

Purpose
-------

The goal of this documentation portal is to help you access and discover the Rubin Observatory’s public technical documentation. This portal is available to everyone: the observatory team, the astronomy community, and the general public.

Although there may be some public technical documentation that is not yet available through this search portal, we index all our technote document series, and are adding new sources all the time. See [the content coverage table](#content-coverage), below for details.

_Documentation that isn’t public is beyond the scope of this portal._ Observatory team members should log into individual platforms to find non-public information, such as [DocuShare](https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/HomePage), [Jira](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa), [Confluence](https://confluence.lsstcorp.org), or the [Project homepage](https://project.lsst.org/).

Content coverage
----------------

Content types are added systematically as we develop our content indexer, [Ook](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/ook). The following table summarizes the types of content that are currently available through the portal, along with content types that we anticipate adding in the future.
