# How to document releases

## Release notes

Release notes are published through the `releases/vXX_Y_Z.rst` files; one per each release In addition, the `releases/tickets/vXX_Y_Z.rst` file lists all the tickets closed in the corresponding release.

To start release notes for a new release:

  1. Create a new file in `releases/` based on the template below
  2. Create a new file in `releases/tickets` listing all the tickets closed in this release
  3. Remove the `release-latest` label from the previous latest release
  4. Add an entry for `vXX_Y_Z` to `releases/index.rst`
