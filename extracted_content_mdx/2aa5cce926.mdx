# Vera C. Rubin Observatory Documentation for Data Preview 0.3 (DP0.3)#

This site provides information about the Rubin Observatoryâs Data Preview 0.3 (DP0.3), which only contains simulated Solar System objects, and is completely independent of the simulated DP0.2 data set.

The DP0.3 data is available only via the Rubin Science Platform (RSP). For access, please follow the getting started with DP0 checklist.

**Credit:** The DP0.3 data set was generated by members of the Rubin Solar System Pipelines and Commissioning teams, with help from the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration, in particular: Pedro Bernardinelli, Jake Kurlander, Joachim Moeyens, Samuel Cornwall, Ari Heinze, Steph Merritt, Lynne Jones, Siegfried Eggl, Meg Schwamb, Grigori Fedorets, and Mario Juric.

Important

This website describes only the DP0.3 data products and tutorials. Visit dp0-2.lsst.io for information about the galactic and extragalactic simulated data products. Visit dp0.lsst.io for information about how to:

  * get an RSP account to access the DP0 data (become a DP0 delegate),

  * ask questions, get help, and report bugs, or to

  * participate in virtual events (e.g., hands-on tutorials for DP0).




## DP0.3 data products#

The DP0.3 simulation only contains catalog data products for Solar System objects. For simulated Galactic and extragalactic data products, see the documentation for DP0.2.

**Be aware of these** Known issues **with the DP0.3 simulation.**
