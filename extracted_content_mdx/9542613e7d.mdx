# LSST EFD Client

The LSST EFD Client helps you access the LSST Engineering Facility Database (EFD) inside Sasquatch, which is backed by InfluxDB. The client, `EfdClient`, handles authentication and provides convenience methods for accessing data in ready-to-use formats:

## Features

  * The client `EfdClient`, has several useful functions.

    * `get_topics`: Return the topics in the EFD.
    * `get_fields`: Return the fields in a particular topic
    * `build_time_range_query`: Build an InfluxQL query for a topic and time range
    * `select_time_series`: Return a DataFrame containing results of a time range query
    * `select_packed_time_series`: Return a DataFrame with high cadence telemetry expanded into a single DataFrame.
    * `select_top_n`: Return a DataFrame with the results of just the most recent rows.
    * `get_schema`: Get metadata for the fields in a particular topic.
  * There are also some utilities for dealing with results of queries

    * `merge_packed_time_series`: Takes a dataframe with records that have multiple samples per entry and returns a dataframe with one record per sample.
    * `rendezvous_dataframes`: Extend on dataframe with data from another dataframe using the closest record in time in the past, in the future, or nearest overall.



Example notebooks are available in lsst-sqre/system-test.

Documentation is available at https://efd-client.lsst.io.
