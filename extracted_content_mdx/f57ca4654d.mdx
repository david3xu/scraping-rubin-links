# LSST DM Developer GuideÂ¶

This is an internal guide for LSST DM staff during project construction, and for Rubin Observatory Data Production staff in operations. Itâs also openly available so that others can understand how weâre building the LSSTâs data management subsystem. In some cases, other Rubin groups (for example Telescope & Site Software) have chosen to follow various sections as it applies to them.

This guide includes a mix of normative requirements and helpful, descriptive, pages. When itâs particularly important that you closely follow a standard, we include an annotation box at the top of the page.

Any member of DM can contribute to this guide. Itâs published from the https://github.com/lsst-dm/dm_dev_guide GitHub repo. Check out the README to get started.
