# ts_mtdome

`ts_mtdome` is a Commandable SAL Component (CSC) to control the dome for the Simonyi Survey Telescope at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

Documentation

The package is compatible with Vera Rubin LSST DM's `scons` build system, and the eups package management system. Assuming you have the basic DM stack installed you can do the following, from within the package directory:

  * `setup -r .` to setup the package and dependencies.
  * `scons` to build the package and run unit tests.
  * `scons install declare` to install the package and declare it to eups.
  * `package-docs build` to build the documentation. This requires `documenteer`; see building single package docs for installation instructions.



This code uses `pre-commit` to maintain `black` formatting and `flake8` compliance. To enable this:

  * Run `pre-commit install` once.
  * If directed, run `git config --unset-all core.hooksPath` once.
