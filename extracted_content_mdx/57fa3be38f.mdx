# lsst.ts.ATDomeTrajectoryÂ¶

## OverviewÂ¶

ATDomeTrajectory moves the Vera C. Rubin Auxiliary Telescope dome to follow the telescope. It does this by reading telescope position from the ATMCS CSC (or ATMCSSimulator CSC if simulating the ATMCS) and issuing commands to the ATDome CSC.

Unlike most observatory enclosures, we plan to slowly rotate the dome during exposures, in order to minimize the time required to move to the next target. ATDomeTrajectory supports multiple algorithms for determining how to move the dome, though at present only one simple algorithm is available.

## User GuideÂ¶

Start the ATDomeTrajectory CSC as follows:
    
    
    run_atdometrajectory.py
    

Stop the CSC by sending it to the OFFLINE state.

To make the dome follow the telescope: issue the ATDomeTrajectory setEnabledMode command with `enabled=True`.

To move the dome to a specified azimuth that is different from the telescopeâs azimuth:

  * Stop the dome from following: issue the ATDomeTrajectory setEnabledMode command with `enabled=False`.

  * Move the dome: issue the ATDome moveAzimuth command with `azimuth=desired_azimuth`.




ATDomeTrajectory can support multiple algorithms for making the dome follow the telescope; but at the time of this writing, there is only one. The algorithm is specified and configured in configuration.

### SimulationÂ¶

ATDomeTrajectory can be fully exercised without hardware by running the ATMCSSimulator CSC and running ATDome CSC in simulation mode. ATDomeTrajectory does not have a simulation mode of its own.

### ConfigurationÂ¶

Configuration is defined by CONFIG_SCHEMA. Configuration primarily consists of specifying the control algorithm and its associated parameters.

Available algorithms:

  * `SimpleAlgorithm`




Configuration files live in ts_config_attcs/ATDomeTrajectory.

Here is a sample configuration file that specifies all fields:
    
    
    # We strongly suggest that you specify the algorithm name
    # if you override any of the algorithm's default configuration.
    # That way your configuration file will continue to work
    # even if the default algorithm changes.
    algorithm_name: "simple"
    algorithm_config:
      # This value is abitrary and merely for illustration.
      # It can be omitted, and the default is reasonable.
      max_delta_azimuth: 3.5
