# RoundtableÂ¶

## An obsolete application platform by SQuaREÂ¶

At SQuaRE, we love building bots, microservices, and apps that help the LSST Project get its work done. Roundtable was once a new initiative to bring many of these services under one roof to leverage common resources, like a Kubernetes cluster, HTTP ingress for APIs, Kafka for event-based apps, monitoring and logging, and continuous deployment patterns. It has since been supplanted by Phalanx, which contains a `Roundtable` project. All new development of Roundtable applications should be done within Phalanx, and we are actively working on sunsetting Original Roundtable.
