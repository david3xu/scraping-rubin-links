# lsst.ts.hexapodÂ¶

## OverviewÂ¶

The Hexapod CSC controls the camera and M2 hexapods on the Simonyi Survey Telescope. Run one instance of the CSC for each hexapod, using index=1 for the camera hexapod and index=2 for the M2 hexapod.

## User GuideÂ¶

Start a Hexapod CSC as follows:
    
    
    run_hexapod.py <index>
    

where `<index>` is 1 for the camera hexapod, 2 for the M2 hexapod

Then check that the CSC has control of the low-level controller, as follows:

  * Wait for the `connected` event to report `command=True` and `telemetry=True`. This should happen quickly; if it does not then check that the low-level controller is fully booted up and configured to use the correct IP address for the CSC.
  * Check the `controllerState` event. If it is `state=Offline, offline_substate=PublishOnly`, which is the state the low-level controller wakes up in, then you must use the EUI to change the state.
  * Check the `commandableByDDS` event. If `state=False` then you must use the EUI to change the control mode.



### NotesÂ¶

  * To recover from the `FAULT` state (after fixing whatever is wrong) issue the `clearError` command. This will transition to the `STANDBY` state.
  * The low-level controller maintains the CSC summary state, so the CSC reports a summary state of `OFFLINE` until it receives telemetry from the low-level controller. Thus the CSC may transition from `OFFLINE` to almost any other state as it starts up.
  * Communication between the low-level controller and CSC is quite unusual:
    * The low-level controller connects to a TCP/IP _server_ in the CSC. Thus the low-level controller must be configured with the TCP/IP address of the CSC.
    * The low-level controller does not acknowledge commands in any way. Thus the CSC must try to predict whether the low-level controller can execute a command and reject the command if not. Unfortunately this prediction cannot be completely accurate.
    * The connection uses two separate sockets, one for commands and the other for telemetry and configuration. Both are one-directional: the low-level controller reads commands on the command socket and writes configuration and telemetry to the telemetry socket.



### SimulatorÂ¶

The CSC includes a simulation mode. To run using CSCâs internal simulator:
    
    
    run_hexapod.py <index> --simulate
    

### The Engineering User Interface (EUI)Â¶

Use the Engineering User Interface (EUI) as follows to enable CSC control of the low-level controller:

>   * State must be `state=Offline, offline_substate=Available` or any more enabled state. The low-level controller wakes up in `state=Offline, offline_substate=PublishOnly`, and you must change this before the CSC can control the low-level controller. Change the state on the main panel of the EUI.
>   * Control mode must be `DDS`. The low-level controller wakes up in control mode `GUI`, and you must change this before the CSC can control the low-level controller. To change the control mode use the `Parameters` panel; note that the EUI _shows_ the control mode on the main panel, but that display is read-only.
