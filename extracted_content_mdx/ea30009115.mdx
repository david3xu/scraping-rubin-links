# cbp

Code for the collimated beam projector (CBP)

Documentation

The package is designed for use with the Vera Rubin LSST DM's scons build system and eups package management system. Assuming you have the basic DM stack installed you can do the following, from within the package directory:

  * `setup -r .` to setup the package and dependencies, at which point the unit tests can be run and the package can be used "in place".
  * `pytest` or `scons` to run the unit tests.
  * `scons install declare` to install the package and declare it to eups.
  * `package-docs build` to build the documentation
