# ts_CBP

CBP is a Commandable SAL Component for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. It controls a Collimated Beam Projector for the Main Telescope Calibration System.

## Installation

pip/setuptools method
    
    
    pip install -e .[dev]
    pytest --cov lsst.ts.cbp -ra

### Requirements

This project uses the `black` linter.

Run the following once in the repository
    
    
    pre-commit install
    

`black` will now run as a pre-commit git hook.

There is a plugin pytest-black that checks if any files have not been linted by `black`.

## Usage
    
    
    from lsst.ts import salobj
    
    domain = salobj.Domain()
    
    cbp = salobj.Remote(name="CBP", domain=domain)
    
    await cbp.start_task
    
    
    
    await cbp.cmd_moveAzimuth.set_start(azimuth=20, timeout=10)
    await cbp.cmd_moveAltitude.set_start(altitude=30, timeout=10)
    await cbp.changeMask.set_start(mask=1)
    
    
    
    azimuth = await cbp.tel_azimuth.aget(timeout=2)
    altiude = await cbp.tel_altitude.aget(timeout=2)
    
    
    
    await domain.close()
