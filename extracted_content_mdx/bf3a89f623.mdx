Hello fellow octoinvaders! I want to brainstorm new ideas for power-ups. What's the Mona equivalent to coin boxes and mushrooms?

Echoing what **@pifafu** said, I’d love to see Hubot show up as the sidekick delivering the power-ups. He'd give Mona superpowers similar to how GitHub products give developers superpowers. Here is a potential list based on the current features:

A power-up could be calling Hubot and they would magically reveal the path and protect Mona for a set period of time.

What if Hubot was some sort of provider of power-up and gave different types of power/objects depending on levels?

I like the collaboration idea, perfect fit for the characters.

**jesussandreas** 10 min ago

What about a jetpack to make Mona 10x faster for 10s.

**cameronfoxly** 5 min ago

Magic portals could be sweet and add some randomness.

In the same vein, a merge tool could be a cool hint.

Thanks for all the work on the latest updates to our game. This got me thinking, should we think about adding power-ups?

Let's move this conversation out of our mechanics work and ask the community.
