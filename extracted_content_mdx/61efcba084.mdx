### Data Preview 0.2

DP0.2 is the second phase of the Data Preview 0 program using precursor data (simulated images from the DESC DC2 data challenge) hosted on the Rubin Science Platform.

    lsst/dp0-2_lsst_io

### Data Preview 0.3

DP0.3 provides a catalog of solar system objects from a simulated LSST ten-year wide-fast-deep survey by the Solar System Science Collaboration.

### LSST Science Pipelines

The LSST Science Pipelines are designed to enable optical and near-infrared astronomy in the “big data” era. While they are being developed to process the data for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin’s LSST), our command line and programming interfaces can be extended to address any optical or near-infrared dataset.

Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a Federal project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science, with early construction funding received from private donations through the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded LSST (now Rubin Observatory) Project Office for construction was established as an operating center under the management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). The DOE-funded effort to build the Rubin Observatory LSST Camera (LSSTCam) is managed by SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).

NSF and DOE will continue to support Rubin Observatory in its operations phase to carry out the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. They will also provide support for scientific research with the data. During operations, NSF funding is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with NSF, and DOE funding is managed by SLAC under contract by DOE. Rubin Observatory is operated by NSF's NOIRLab and SLAC.
