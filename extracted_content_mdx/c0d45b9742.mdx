# neophile

neophile is a dependency scanner. It looks through a repository for declared dependencies, attempts to determine if those dependencies are out of date, and optionally updates them, either directly in the working tree or by creating a GitHub pull request.

neophile was written to fill gaps betwen GitHub Dependabot and Mend Renovate. It currently supports updating pre-commit hooks and frozen Python dependencies that use `make update-deps`.

For full documentation, see the manual.

See SQR-042 for more details about the problem statement and the gap that neophile fills.
