# lsst.ts.ATPneumaticsSimulatorÂ¶

A simulator for the auxiliary telescope pneumatics control system (ATPneumatics CSC).

## Using lsst.ts.ATPneumaticsSimulatorÂ¶

The package is compatible with LSST DMâs `scons` build system and `eups` package management system. Assuming you have the basic LSST DM stack installed you can do the following, from within the package directory:

  * `setup -r .` to setup the package and dependencies.

  * `scons` to build the package and run unit tests.

  * `scons install declare` to install the package and declare it to eups.

  * `package-docs build` to build the documentation. This requires `documenteer`; see building single package docs for installation instructions.




With the package built and set up you can run the simulator using:

> run_atpneumatics_simulator.py
