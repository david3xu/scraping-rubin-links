# MTAOSÂ¶

## OverviewÂ¶

The Main Telescope Active Optics System (MTAOS) Commandable SAL Component (CSC) is operating the closed-loop optical system. MTAOS calculates the wavefront error based on defocal images obtained with corner raft wavefront sensor, estimates the optical state, and sends the correction in the forms of bending modes and rigid body positions to the mirrors and hexapods. DDS/SAL (Service Abstraction Layer) is used to send or receive commands/events/telemetry among telescopeâs subsystems such as M1M3/M2 static support, M2/camera hexapod, etc.

In automatic operation, MTAOS will be controlled by the Telescope Control System (TCS) to do the closed-loop correction. MTAOS is part of the Main Telescope Control Packages. The backbone of CSC is using the ts_salobj library, which defines the state transitions. The summary state machine is defined in TCS Software Component Interface and there is no detailed state defined in MTAOS. The eups is used as the package manager.

Financial support for LSST comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through Cooperative Agreement No. 1258333, the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science under Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515, and private funding raised by the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded LSST Project Office for construction was established as an operating center under management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). The DOE-funded effort to build the LSST camera is managed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).
