# nbreportÂ¶

nbreport is a client for creating and publishing LSSTâs notebook-based reports. Notebook-based reports are generated from template repositories, computed, and published with LSST the Docs.

nbreport is developed on GitHub at https://github.com/lsst-sqre/nbreport. The design document is https://sqr-023.lsst.io.

## InstallationÂ¶
    
    
    pip install nbreport
    

nbreport is built for Python 3.6 and newer.

## Try it outÂ¶

This one-line command creates a test report instance:
    
    
    nbreport test https://github.com/lsst-sqre/nbreport --git-subdir tests/TESTR-000 \
        -c username $USER -c date `date +"%F"` -c a 20
    

This test command uses the TESTR-000 example report repository in this projectâs own Git repository. Next, it creates a new report instance called `TESTR-000-test` in your current working directory and configures the values for three variables in the notebook template: `username`, `date`, and `a`. Finally, the test command runs the notebook to generate outputs.
