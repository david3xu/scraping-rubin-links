# Templatekit

Templatekit is a Python library and command-line app for using and maintaining a centralized repository of project and file templates. Templates are built with Cookiecutter and Jinja. https://github.com/lsst/templates is the primary repository that Templatekit is built for, but Templatekit can be used for other template repository projects.
