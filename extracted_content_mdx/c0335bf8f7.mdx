# ts_atpneumaticssimulator

`ts_atpneumaticssimulator` is an LSST Telescope and Site package that provides a simulator for the auxiliary telescope pneumatics controller: ATPneumatics.

Documentation

The package is compatible with `setuptools`, as well as the eups package management system and `scons` build system. Assuming you have the basic Vera C. Rubin LSST DM stack installed you can do the following, from within the package directory:

  * `setup -r .` to setup the package and dependencies, at which point the unit tests can be run and the package can be used "in place".
  * `pytest` to run the unit tests.
  * `python setup.py install` to install the software.
  * `package-docs build` to build the documentation. This requires `documenteer`; see building single package docs for installation instructions.



This code uses `pre-commit` to maintain `black` formatting and `flake8` compliance. To enable this, run the following commands once (the first removes the previous pre-commit hook):
    
    
    git config --unset-all core.hooksPath
    pre-commit install
