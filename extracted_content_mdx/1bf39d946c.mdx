# lsst.display.firefly â visualization backend for FireflyÂ¶

`lsst.display.firefly` is a backend for the `lsst.afw.display` interface, allowing the Firefly visualization framework to be used for displaying data objects from the stack.

## IntroductionÂ¶

Firefly is a web framework for astronomical data access and visualization, developed at Caltech/IPAC and deployed for the archives of several major facilities including Spitzer, WISE, Plank and others. Firefly is a part of the LSST Science User Platform. Its client-server architecture is designed to enable a user to easily visualize images and catalog data from a remote site.

The `lsst.display.firefly` backend is a client that can connect to a Firefly server and visualize data objects from an LSST stack session. It is best used with a Python session and Firefly server that are both remote and situated close to the data.

A user typically will not import `lsst.display.firefly` directly. Instead, the `lsst.afw.display` interface will commonly be used with `backend=firefly`.

## Getting StartedÂ¶

This short example uses data that has been run through the LSST stack demo.

At a shell prompt:
    
    
    setup obs_sdss
    setup display_firefly
    

Start a Python session of some kind in the directory where the demo was run. Then these statements will create a Butler instance for the processed data and then retrieve an exposure.
    
    
    from lsst.daf.persistence import Butler
    butler = Butler('./output')
    calexp = butler.get('calexp', run=4192, camcol=4, field=300, filter='g')
    

The next lines will set up the display, using a public Firefly server.
    
    
    import lsst.afw.display as afw_display
    afw_display.setDefaultBackend('lsst.display.firefly')
    display1 = afw_display.getDisplay(frame=1,
       host='lsst-demo.ncsa.illinois.edu', port=80,
       name='mychannel')
    

Open a browser window to http://lsst-demo.ncsa.illinois.edu/firefly?__wsch=mychannel. Then display the exposure:
    
    
    display1.mtv(calexp)
    

The displayed exposure will appear in your browser.

Subsequent displays can be opened more simply:
    
    
    display2 = afw_display.getDisplay(frame=2)
    

## Using lsst.display.fireflyÂ¶

The `lsst.display.firefly` package is not used directly. Instead, instances of `lsst.afw.display` are created with parameters passed to the backend. The Firefly backend is based upon the Python API in `firefly_client.FireflyClient`.

### SetupÂ¶

Before a Python session or Jupyter notebook is started, setup of stack packages must be completed. Use **setup display_firefly** to enable the Firefly backend.

### Initializing with lsst.afw.displayÂ¶

The recommended way to create a display object for Firefly is using the `getDisplay()` method from `lsst.afw.display`:
    
    
    import lsst.afw.display as afw_display
    afw_display.setDefaultBackend('lsst.display.firefly')
    display1 = afw_display.getDisplay(frame=1, host='localhost', port=8080,
                                   basedir='firefly', name='afw')
    

The parameters shown above (besides `frame`) are the defaults and will apply when running a Firefly server locally with default settings.

If a Firefly server has been provided to you, set `host`, `port`, and `basedir` according to the information provided. You should set `name` to a unique string to avoid another user from writing to your display.

Warning

Once a `Display` instance is made, within your Python session it will not be possible to define another display pointing to a different server.

### Opening a browser windowÂ¶

A browser window or tab must be opened before any data are displayed.

When using a Firefly server on `localhost`, creating the display object will cause a browser window to open to the correct location. If using another server (as in the above example), the `display1.show()` method opens the browser window, if your Python session is on your local machine.

When running a remote Python session, or one inside a container, you will need to open a browser window or tab on your local machine yourself. For example, for `host=lsst-dev`, `port=8085`, `basedir=firefly`, `name=mine`, use the url `http://lsst-dev:8085/firefly?__wsch=mine`.

### Displaying an imageÂ¶

The `mtv()` method of your display is used to display Exposures, MaskedImages and Images from the stack. Assuming that your session includes an Exposure named `calexp`:
    
    
    display1.mtv(calexp)
    

### Mask display and manipulationÂ¶

If the data object passed to `mtv()` contains masks, these will automatically be overlaid on the image. A layer control icon at the top of the browser window can be used to turn mask layers on and off.

The `display1.setMaskPlaneColor()` and `display1.setMaskTransparency()` methods can be used to programmatically change the mask display. `display1.setMaskPlaneColor()` must be used before the image is displayed, while the transparency may be changed at any time.
    
    
    display1.setMaskPlaneColor('DETECTED', afw_display.GREEN)
    display1.mtv(calexp)
    display1.setMaskTransparency(30)
    

### Image scale, zoom, panÂ¶

The `display1` object includes methods for setting the image scale or stretch, the zoom and the pan position.
    
    
    display1.scale('log', -1, 10, 'sigma')
    display1.zoom(4)
    display1.pan(1064, 890)
    

### Overlaying symbolsÂ¶

The `display1.dot()` method will overlay a symbol at a point.
    
    
    display1.dot('x', 1064, 890, size=8, ctype=afw_display.RED)
    

## Installing lsst.display.fireflyÂ¶

Since `display_firefly` is not yet included in the `lsst_distrib` set of stack packages, this section outlines several installation scenarios.

### Installing with eups distrib installÂ¶

To check for published distributions of `display_firefly`, use
    
    
    eups distrib list display_firefly -s https://sw.lsstcorp.org/eupspkg
    

This command will return the published versions of `display_firefly`, with the third item displayed as the EUPS version. Provide that version to `eups distrib install display_firefly`, e.g.:
    
    
    eups distrib install display_firefly master-g83bca5e38c+1
    

The version may not be compatible with the version of the stack you are using. This will be fixed when `display_firefly` is included in the `lsst_distrib` distribution.

### Developer installation from source codeÂ¶

#### Install using lsstswÂ¶

If using `lsstsw` to develop with the stack, rebuild the package:
    
    
    rebuild display_firefly
    

Note the build number NNNN that is output by the rebuild process, then:
    
    
    eups tags --clone bNNNN current
    

#### Install using Github and sconsÂ¶

Set up the stack with `lsst_distrib` or an obs package such as `obs_sdss`.

Clone and install `display_firefly`:
    
    
    git clone https://github.com/lsst/display_firefly
    cd display_firefly
    setup -j -r . -t $USER
    scons
    

Install the dependency `firefly_client` with `pip install firefly_client`.

## Firefly ServersÂ¶

Ideally, a Firefly server sitting close to your data and your Python workspace will have been provided to you. In some cases you may want to run your own Firefly server.

### Firefly server using DockerÂ¶

With Docker installed, you can start a Firefly server with 8 GB of memory on port 8080:
    
    
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "MAX_JVM_SIZE=8G" --rm ipac/firefly
    

To run it on port 8090, in the background and saving logging information to a file:
    
    
    docker run -p 8090:8080  -e "MAX_JVM_SIZE=8G" --rm ipac/firefly >& my.log &
    

Useful Docker commands may be found in this cheat sheet.

### Standalone Firefly using JavaÂ¶

A Firefly server may be run from a single file using Java 8.

  * Point your web browser to the Firefly release page at https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly/releases

  * Download the latest `firefly-exec.war`

  * Start Firefly with **java -jar firefly-exec.war**

>     * Use option `-httpPort 9080` to run on port 9080 instead of the default 8080
>     * Use option `-extractDirectory <dirname>` to extract the contents to a different directory instead of the default `./extract`
>     * On Mac OS X, it may be necessary to add the option `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true`. If using this server locally, you may need to use host `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`
