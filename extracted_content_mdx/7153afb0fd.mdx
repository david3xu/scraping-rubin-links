# LSST Service Directory

This Sphinx site is an index of services deployed by the Rubin Observatory's SQuaRE team. View it at https://services.lsst.io.

## Contributing

  1. Create a virtual environment (if you haven't already):
    
        python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

**Tip:** activate this virtual environment in another shell by re-running the `source` command.

  2. Install dependencies:
    
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

  3. Build the site:
    
        make html

Open `_build/html/index.html` in a browser to review it.

  4. To completely clear the build:
    
        make clean

  5. To check links:
    
        make linkcheck

If some links are behind a login, you might need to ignore them. Look at the `linkcheck_ignore` variable in `conf.py` for examples of how to do this.




## Deployment

Whenever you push a GitHub, the site is built for the corresponding branch. Find your build at https://services.lsst.io/v.

The `master` branch is always published as https://services.lsst.io.
