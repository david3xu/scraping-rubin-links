# astro_metadata_translator

Observation metadata handling infrastructure

This package can be used to translate headers from astronomical instrumentation into a standard form. This allows the details of particular headers to be hidden from the user of the data files.

This package was developed by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Data Management team.

It does not depend on any LSST software.
