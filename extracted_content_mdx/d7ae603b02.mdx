Erik Bursch

VP, Product Technology

Fastly helps GIPHY cut costs and boost performance while serving billions of images daily.

âFastly is integral to GIPHY because every time our developers have a new idea, and we ask, "Can we build this on Fastly?" The answer is always, "Yes, we can." Fastly has really proven its worth through its developer experience and how easily we can pivot and stay agile as a company. Fastly has always been flexible and easy to work with.â

âWe often look at our Fastly logs before we look at our originâs logs. Once, we did a release, and it turned out that there was an edge case throwing tons of service errors. We looked up at our big Fastly Dashboard in the office and noticed that the pattern of errors had radically altered. By visualizing Fastlyâs logs, we are able to identify and quickly fix bugs.â

### What is the modern CDN and why is it important?

Too many developers and companies are dealing with the dark ages of black-box, legacy content delivery networks (CDNs) that werenât built to provide the real-time observability, baked-in security, and programmatic control needed to deliver the dynamic experiences todayâs users and developers demand.
