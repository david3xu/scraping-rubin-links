Avoid doing a Butler write in DP02_14 

Browse files Browse the repository at this point in the history
    
    
    Removed an unnecessary round-trip of the injection catalog through the
    Butler from tutorial DP02_14.  The ingestion of this catalog was effectively
    writing it and reading it back unchanged, so it isn't necessary.
    
    We are about to transition DP02 to use client/server Butler.  Client/server
    Butler does not yet support writes.
