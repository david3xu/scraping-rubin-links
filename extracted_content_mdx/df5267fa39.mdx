# tutorial-notebooks-dp01-archive

An archive of the tutorial Jupyter Notebooks from Data Preview 0.1, created by the Rubin Observatory Community Engagement Team (CET).

This archive is frozen, and these notebooks are no longer supported or maintained. See the tutorial-notebooks repository for the most up-to-date versions of the CET's notebooks.

  
Title Description  
01\. Intro to DP0 Notebooks Use a python notebook; query a DC2 catalog and plot data; retrieve and display a DC2 image.  
02\. Intermediate TAP Queries Query, and retrieve DC2 catalog data with the Table Access Protocol (TAP) service. Use bokeh and holoviews to create interactive plots.  
03\. Image Display and Manipulation Display and manipulate DC2 images, explore image mask planes, create cutout and RGB images.  
03b. Image Display with Firefly Demonstrates the Firefly interactive interface for viewing image data.  
04\. Intro to Butler Discover, query, retrieve, and display DC2 images and catalog data with the Generation 3 Butler.  
05\. Intro to Source Detection Use the LSST Science Pipelines tasks for image characterization, source detection, deblending, measurement, and to interact with a source footprint.  
06\. Comparing Object and Truth Table Retrieve and merge data from the DC2 Object and Truth-Match tables, and compare simulated and measured properties.  
07\. _(time-domain tutorial)_ TBD  
08a. Interactive Image Visualization Use Holoviews to display an image and overlay detected sources. Use DynamicMap to interact with image data.  
08b. Interactive Catalog Visualization Use Holoviews and Bokeh to display and interact with catalog data. Use Datashader to visualize very large datasets interactively.  
09\. Single Star LC with Butler Demonstrate limits of building light curves during DP0.1: use the Butler to retrieve all PVI sources within a small radius of a given sky coordinate.  
  
The DP0.1 documentation can be found at dp0-1.lsst.io.
