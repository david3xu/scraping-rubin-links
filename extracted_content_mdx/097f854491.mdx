## 1. Introduction

This notebook provides an intermediate-level demonstration of how to use the Table Access Protocol (TAP) server and ADQL (Astronomy Data Query Language) to query and retrieve data from the DP0.2 catalogs.

TAP provides standardized access to catalog data for discovery, search, and retrieval.
Full <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP">documentation for TAP</a> is provided by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA).
ADQL is similar to SQL (Structured Query Langage).
The <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html">documentation for ADQL</a> includes more information about syntax and keywords.
Note that not all ADQL functionality is supported yet in the DP0-era RSP.

**See the recommendations for TAP queries in DP0.2 tutorial 02a "Introduction to the TAP Service".**

The [documentation for Data Preview 0.2](https://dp0-2.lsst.io/) includes definitions
of the data products, descriptions of catalog contents, and ADQL recipes.

### 1.1. Package imports

Import general python packages, the Rubin TAP service utilities, and bokeh and holoviews for interactive visualization.


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas

from astropy import units as u
from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord

import bokeh
from bokeh.io import output_file, output_notebook, show
from bokeh.layouts import gridplot
from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, CDSView, GroupFilter, HoverTool
from bokeh.plotting import figure
from bokeh.transform import factor_cmap

import holoviews as hv

from lsst.rsp import get_tap_service, retrieve_query
```

### 1.2. Define functions and parameters

Instantiate the TAP service.


```python
service = get_tap_service("tap")
assert service is not None
```

Set the maximum number of rows to display from pandas.


```python
pandas.set_option('display.max_rows', 6)
```

Configure bokeh to generate output in notebook cells when show() is called.


```python
output_notebook()
```

Create dictionaries for standard symbols, colors, and labels to use when
plotting data in the six LSST filters.


```python
plot_filter_labels = ['u', 'g', 'r', 'i', 'z', 'y']
plot_filter_colors = {'u': '#56b4e9', 'g': '#008060', 'r': '#ff4000',
                      'i': '#850000', 'z': '#6600cc', 'y': '#000000'}
plot_filter_symbols = {'u': 'o', 'g': '^', 'r': 'v', 'i': 's', 'z': '*', 'y': 'p'}
```

## 2. Column manipulation

Define the coordinates and radius to use for the example queries in Sections 2 and 3.


```python
center_ra = 62
center_dec = -37
radius = 0.01

str_center_coords = str(center_ra) + ", " + str(center_dec)
str_radius = str(radius)
```

Start with the same query as used in the beginner TAP tutorial notebook 02a.


```python
query = "SELECT coord_ra, coord_dec "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str_center_coords + ", " + str_radius + ")) = 1 "\
        "AND detect_isPrimary = 1"
print(query)
```

Run the query job asynchronously.


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```

Return the results as a `pandas` dataframe.


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```

Display `results`.


```python
results
```

Clean up.


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

### 2.1. Rename columns

Columns can be renamed by using `AS`.
For example, use the same query as above but rename `coord_ra` and `coord_dec` 
as `ra` and `dec`.


```python
query = "SELECT coord_ra AS ra, "\
        "coord_dec AS dec "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str_center_coords + ", " + str_radius + ")) = 1 "\
        "AND detect_isPrimary = 1"
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```


```python
results
```

Above, see the columns have been renamed in the `results` dataframe.


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

### 2.2. Apply functions

A variety of mathematical, trigonometrical, and geometrical functions can be applied to columns,
with the results stored as columns in the returned array.
See the [ADQL documentation](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html) for the full list.

Below, use the same query as above but convert the coordinates from degrees to radians,
and rename the columns `ra_radians` and `dec_radians`.


```python
query = "SELECT RADIANS(coord_ra) AS ra_radians, "\
        "RADIANS(coord_dec) AS dec_radians "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str_center_coords + ", " + str_radius + ")) = 1 "\
        "AND detect_isPrimary = 1"
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```


```python
results
```


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

### 2.3. Convert fluxes to magnitudes

Photometric measurements for LSST objects are stored in the catalogs as fluxes with units of nanoJanskys (nJy).

The conversion from nJy to [AB magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_magnitude) is
$m_{\rm AB} = -2.5 \log(f_{\rm nJy}) + 31.4$.

> **Warning:** Photometric measurements performed on difference images (images for which a "template" or "reference" image
> of the same field has been subtracted) can be negative. Take care if converting fluxes from catalogs that are the result of difference image analysis (DIA).

A function has been created to return fluxes as AB magnitudes: `scisql_nanojanskyToAbMab`.

The query below converts the $g$-band `cModelFlux` to the $g$-band AB magnitude two ways,
first using the equation (`gmag1`) and also using the function (`gmag2`), and the function
for the error.
See Section 5.1 for a description of the `cModel` flux.


```python
query = "SELECT coord_ra, coord_dec, "\
        "-2.5 * LOG10(g_cModelFlux) + 31.4 AS gmag1, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(g_cModelFlux) AS gmag2, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMagSigma(g_cModelFlux, g_cModelFluxErr) AS gmag2err "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str_center_coords + ", " + str_radius + ")) = 1 "\
        "AND detect_isPrimary = 1"
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```


```python
results
```


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

### 2.4. Retrieve derived columns

Here, a "derived column" refers to a column which has been create from other columns.

The query below retrives the $gri$-band AB magnitudes, and
derives the $g-r$ and $r-i$ colors and returns them as separate columns `grclr` and `riclr`.

It is the convention in astronomy to defined colors as the subtraction of the magnitudes, $c = m_1 - m_2$, not the fluxes.
It is also the convention that the longer-wavelength filter is always subtracted from shorter-wavelength filter.
In this convention, $m_1 - m_2 = c > 0$ indicates a "redder" object, and $c < 0$ is a "bluer" object.


```python
query = "SELECT scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(g_cModelFlux) AS gmag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_cModelFlux) AS rmag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(i_cModelFlux) AS imag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(g_cModelFlux) - "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_cModelFlux) AS grclr, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_cModelFlux) - "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(i_cModelFlux) AS riclr "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str_center_coords + ", " + str_radius + ")) = 1 "\
        "AND detect_isPrimary = 1"
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```


```python
results
```

Create a scatter plot to show the colors. Plot horizontal and vertical line at color 0.


```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))
plt.plot(results['grclr'], results['riclr'],
         'o', mew=0, ms=3, alpha=0.5, color='black')
plt.axvline(0.0, lw=1, color='grey')
plt.axhline(0.0, lw=1, color='grey')
plt.xlim([-1, 2])
plt.ylim([-2, 2])
plt.xlabel('g-r color')
plt.ylabel('r-i color')
plt.show()
```

Figure 1: A color-color scatter plot with $g-r$ on the x-axis and $r-i$ on the y-axis.


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

## 3. Column constraints

In the query above, two constraints are used: the spatial constraint that a catalog object's
coordinates must be within a certain radius of a defined point of interest, and that the
object's `detect_isPrimary` flag must be `True`.

This section demonstrates other types of column constraints.

### 3.1. Comparison operators

In the queries above, on the `=` operator is used,
but others are available, e.g., `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.

Rewrite `detect_isPrimary = ` as `detect_isPrimary != 0`,
and add a constraint that the $i$-band magnitude is less than or equal to 25 mag.


```python
query = "SELECT scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(g_cModelFlux) AS gmag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_cModelFlux) AS rmag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(i_cModelFlux) AS imag "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str_center_coords + ", " + str_radius + ")) = 1 "\
        "AND detect_isPrimary != 0 "\
        "AND scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(i_cModelFlux) <= 25"
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```

Above, see that adding the magnitude constraint has decreased the number of rows returned by the query.


```python
# results
```


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

### 3.2. Operators applied to functions

The `DISTANCE` function will return the distance, in degrees, between two points.

Use the coordinates of one of the objects returned by the queries above to 
define a point: `POINT('ICRS', 61.989258, -37.005119))`.
Retrieve the distance of every other returned object from this object as `dist`.

To furthermore demonstrate that operators can be used in both the `SELECT` and `WHERE`
statements of an ADQL query, apply a constraint that objects must be less
than 0.005 degrees away from the defined point.

Sort the results based on `dist` by including an `ORDER BY` statement.


```python
query = "SELECT coord_ra, coord_dec, "\
        "DISTANCE(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "POINT('ICRS', 61.989258, -37.005119)) AS dist "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str_center_coords + ", " + str_radius + ")) = 1 "\
        "AND detect_isPrimary = 1 "\
        "AND DISTANCE(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "POINT('ICRS', 61.989258, -37.005119)) < 0.005 "\
        "ORDER BY dist ASC"
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```


```python
results
```

Above, see that the first row has a very very small distance (a rounding error) from
the defined point because it is the same object as was used to define the point.


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

### 3.3. Use of `WHERE ... BETWEEN ... AND ...`

A constraint that one columns value is between two other columns' values
can be applied with a statement like `<col1> BETWEEN <col2> AND <col3>`.
The order matters.
The statement `WHERE a BETWEEN b AND c` means $b < a < c$.
Whereas `WHERE a BETWEEN c AND b` means $c < a < b$.

Create a query with the constraint that the $r$-band `cModelFlux` value
is in between the $g$- and $i$-band fluxes: $g < r < i$.
This query will return red objects which have more flux in the redward filters ($r$ and $i$).


```python
query = "SELECT scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(g_cModelFlux) AS gmag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_cModelFlux) AS rmag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(i_cModelFlux) AS imag "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str_center_coords + ", " + str_radius + ")) = 1 "\
        "AND detect_isPrimary = 1 "\
        "AND r_cModelFlux BETWEEN g_cModelFlux AND i_cModelFlux"
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```

With `pandas` dataframes, columns can be derived from other columns after the TAP query.

Create columns for the $g-r$ and $r-i$ colors.


```python
results['grclr'] = results['gmag'] - results['rmag']
results['riclr'] = results['rmag'] - results['imag']
```


```python
# results
```

Create a color-color scatter plot, as in Section 2.4.


```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))
plt.plot(results['grclr'], results['riclr'],
         'o', mew=0, ms=3, alpha=0.5, color='black')
plt.axvline(0.0, lw=1, color='grey')
plt.axhline(0.0, lw=1, color='grey')
plt.xlim([-1, 2])
plt.ylim([-2, 2])
plt.xlabel('g-r color')
plt.ylabel('r-i color')
plt.show()
```

Figure 2: The same as Figure 1, but only for objects with fluxes $f_g < f_r < f_i$,
In other words, only "red" objects with $m_g - m_r > 0$ and $m_r - m_i > 0$.


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

### 3.4. Use of `WHERE ... IN (...)`

The constraint option of `WHERE <col1> IN (value1, value2, value3)` is
a simpler way of doing, e.g., 
`WHERE <col1> = value1 OR <col1> = value2 OR <col1 = value3`.

A scenario where the `WHERE ... IN ()` constraint might be used is when a
colleague has provided a list of `objectId` that they have identified as
targets of interest, and only the rows for those objects are desired.

For example, the `objectId` for 12 objects which were identified as bright stars with similar
$g-r$ and $i-z$ colors are used to define `id_array`.
In the scenario where a colleague provided the list of `objectId`, the array
could have been read in from a file.


```python
id_array = np.asarray((1249537790362809267, 1252528461990360512, 1248772530269893180,
                       1251728017525343554, 1251710425339299404, 1250030371572068167,
                       1253443255664678173, 1251807182362538413, 1252607626827575504,
                       1249784080967440401, 1253065023664713612, 1325835101237446771),
                     dtype='long')
```


```python
id_list = "(" + ", ".join(str(value) for value in id_array) + ")"
```


```python
print(id_list)
```

The query below retrieves the $griz$ `psfFlux` values, converted to AB magnitudes.
The PSF fluxes are retrieved instead of `cModel` fluxes because these objects were
already identified as stars, point sources, and so fluxes which assume the object
has the shape of the point spread function (PSF) are appropriate.

> **Warning:** Very long lists (tens of thousands) can be problematic for the TAP service, and are best avoided.


```python
query = "SELECT objectId, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(g_psfFlux) AS gmag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_psfFlux) AS rmag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_psfFlux) AS imag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(i_psfFlux) AS zmag "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE objectId IN " + id_list
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```


```python
results
```


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

## 4. Table joins

Tables can be joined when they have an index or identifier column in common.

There are four main types of table joins in ADQL/SQL:
 * inner: will return rows that appear in both tables and meet constraints (intersection set)
 * outer: will return rows from either table that meet constraints (union set)
 * left: will return rows from the first table that meet constraints, plus matching rows from the second table
 * right: will return rows from the second table that meet constraints, plus matching rows from the first table

When `JOIN` is used in an ADQL query, it is an inner join by default.

**Generic example:**
To include a table join in an ADQL query requires the specification of which column to be "joined on".
For example, the query below retrieves all rows from "table1" that are within
0.002 degrees of coordinates 62.123, -37.456, but only if there is a row
in "table2" which has the same value of `id` (i.e., an inner join, which is default). 
Columns `mag` and `band` from "table2" are also returned for these matching rows.

```
SELECT t1.id, t1.ra, t1.dec, t2.mag, t2.band
FROM catalog.table1 AS t1
JOIN catalog.table2 AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('IRCS', t1.ra, t1.dec), CIRCLE('ICRS', 62.123, -37.456 0.002)) = 1
```

**Object and Source examples:**
a join between the DP0.2 `Object` and `ForcedSource` tables
is demonstrated in Section 4.1.

**Difference Image Analysis (DIA) examples:**
table joins to create difference-image lightcurves for transient
and variable objects are demonstrated in DP0.2 tutorial notebooks 07a and 07b.

**DP0.2 Truth Match examples:**
table joins with the DP0.2 `MatchesTruth` and `TruthSummary` tables are
demonstrated in DP0.2 tutorial notebook 08.

### 4.1. Variable star lightcurve

A common reason for a table join with DP0.2 is to create lightcurves.

Examples of common joins:
 * `Object` and `ForcedSource` tables on column `objectId`
 * `Source` or `ForcedSource` and `CcdVisit` tables on column `ccdVisitId`

Recall the contents of these tables:
 * `Source` table: measurements for detections in the processed visit images (PVIs)
 * `Object` table: measurements for detections in the deeply stacked images (coadds)
 * `ForcedSource` table: forced photometry on the PVIs at the location of all `Object`s
 * `CcdVisit` table: PVI metadata such a filter, date, exposure time

Note that the `Source` table cannot be joined with the `ForcedSource` or `Object` tables,
because it is the result of independent processing.

First, define the coordinates of a known RR Lyrae variable star.
Use a search radius of $\sim2$".


```python
target_ra = 62.1479031
target_dec = -35.799138
radius = 0.0006

str_target_coords = str(target_ra) + ", " + str(target_dec)
str_radius = str(radius)
```

#### 4.1.1. Single-table query to find the objectId

Find the `objectId` for the variable star with a simple, single-table query.


```python
query = "SELECT objectId "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), "\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str_target_coords + ", " + str_radius + ")) = 1 "\
        "AND detect_isPrimary = 1"
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```

Retrieve the `results` and print the length of the dataframe.
There should be only one row (one match within the small search radius).


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```

Save the `objectId` of the first (and only) row of the `results` dataframe as `str_target_objectId`
for use in Section 4.1.2 below.
Also print it.


```python
str_target_objectId = str(results['objectId'][0])
print(str_target_objectId)
```


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

#### 4.1.2. Two-table join to retrieve the light curve

Find all rows of the `ForcedSource` catalog which are measurements of this object.


```python
query = "SELECT scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(fs.psfFlux) AS mag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMagSigma(fs.psfFlux, fs.psfFluxErr) AS magerr, "\
        "cv.band, cv.expMidptMJD "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.ForcedSource AS fs "\
        "JOIN dp02_dc2_catalogs.CcdVisit AS cv ON fs.ccdVisitId = cv.ccdVisitId "\
        "WHERE fs.objectId = " + str_target_objectId
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```

Retrieve the `results` and print the length of the dataframe.
The length will be the total number of individual observations of the object, in all filters.


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```


```python
# results
```

Print the number of observations in each of the six filters.


```python
values, counts = np.unique(results['band'], return_counts=True)
for value, count in zip(values, counts):
    print(value, count)
del values, counts
```

Plot the $r$- and $i$-band light curve.


```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))
for filt in ['r', 'i']:
    tx = np.where(results['band'] == filt)[0]
    plt.plot(results['expMidptMJD'][tx], results['mag'][tx],
             plot_filter_symbols[filt], alpha=0.5, mew=0,
             color=plot_filter_colors[filt], label=filt)
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.xlabel('Modified Julian Date')
plt.ylabel('Apparent Magnitude')
plt.legend(loc='upper left', handletextpad=0)
plt.show()
```

Figure 3: The light curve for `objectId` = `1651589610221899038`, a known RR Lyrae variable star,
in the $r$ (orange triangles) and $i$ (brown squares) filters.


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

### 4.2. Three-table join to retrieve the light curve

The single-table query for the `objectId` and the two-table join to retrieve
the `ForcedSource` lightcurve can be combined into the following three-table join.


```python
query = "SELECT scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(fs.psfFlux) AS mag, "\
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMagSigma(fs.psfFlux, fs.psfFluxErr) AS magerr, "\
        "cv.band, cv.expMidptMJD "\
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object AS o "\
        "JOIN dp02_dc2_catalogs.ForcedSource AS fs ON o.objectId = fs.objectId "\
        "JOIN dp02_dc2_catalogs.CcdVisit AS cv ON fs.ccdVisitId = cv.ccdVisitId "\
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', o.coord_ra, o.coord_dec), "\
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + str_target_coords + ", " + str_radius + ")) = 1 "\
        "AND o.detect_isPrimary = 1"
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```


```python
# results
```

As these are the exact same data as retrieved in Section 4.1.2 above,
plotting the light curve is left as an exercise for the learner (Section 6).


```python
job.delete()
del query, results
```

## 5. Interactive plots for large data sets

In this section, the **bokeh** package is used to create interactive plots to explore a dataset.
Multiple panels are used to show different representations of the same dataset.
A selection applied to either panel will highlight the selected points in the other panel.

<a href="https://bokeh.org/">Bokeh Documentation</a> <br>
<a href="https://holoviews.org/">Holoviews Documentation</a>

This section uses the same center coordiantes as Section 2 and 3, but instead of a small radius
of 0.01 degrees, a full degree radius is used.


```python
use_center_coords = "62, -37"
use_radius = "1.0"

center_coords = SkyCoord(62, -37, frame='icrs', unit='deg')
search_radius = 1.0*u.deg
```

### 5.1. Create the query

Select rows of the `Object` table within the central search area defined above.
As always with the `Object` catalog, enforce that the `detect_isPrimary` flag is "True" ($=1$).
Only return objects which have $g$, $r$, and $i$-band magnitudes between 17 and 23 mag (using the $<$ and $>$ operators),
and which have a measured r-band extendedness parameter (i.e., it is not NaN or NULL).
Extendedness is typically a parameter between 0 (point-like) and 1 (extended); for DP0.2 it is either 0 or 1.

Return the the `cModelFlux` measurements as magnitudes.
Composite Model (CModel) fluxes are similar in nature to [those measured for SDSS](https://www.sdss3.org/dr8/algorithms/magnitudes.php#cmodel).
In short, it is the linear combination of the best fit exponential and de Vaucouleurs profiles.
The `cModel` type of flux is appropriate to use for extended objects.


```python
query = "SELECT objectId, detect_isPrimary, " + \
        "coord_ra AS ra, coord_dec AS dec, " + \
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(g_cModelFlux) AS mag_g_cModel, " + \
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_cModelFlux) AS mag_r_cModel, " + \
        "scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(i_cModelFlux) AS mag_i_cModel, " + \
        "r_extendedness " + \
        "FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object " + \
        "WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', coord_ra, coord_dec), " + \
        "CIRCLE('ICRS', " + use_center_coords + ", " + use_radius + ")) = 1 " + \
        "AND detect_isPrimary = 1 " + \
        "AND scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(g_cModelFlux) > 17.0 " + \
        "AND scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(g_cModelFlux) < 23.0 " + \
        "AND scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_cModelFlux) > 17.0 " + \
        "AND scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(r_cModelFlux) < 23.0 " + \
        "AND scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(i_cModelFlux) > 17.0 " + \
        "AND scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(i_cModelFlux) < 23.0 " + \
        "AND r_extendedness IS NOT NULL "
print(query)
```


```python
job = service.submit_job(query)
job.run()
job.wait(phases=['COMPLETED', 'ERROR'])
print('Job phase is', job.phase)
```


```python
results = job.fetch_result().to_table().to_pandas()
print(len(results))
```


```python
results
```

### 5.2. Prepare the results for plotting

The basis for any data visualization is the underlying data.

The `ColumnDataSource` (CDS) is the core of bokeh plots.
A CDS can be prepared from the data returned by a query, enabling it to be passed directly to bokeh.
Bokeh automatically creates a CDS from data passed as python lists or numpy arrays.
CDS are useful as they allow data to be shared between multiple plots and renderers, enabling brushing and linking.
A CDS is essentially a collection of sequences of data that have their own unique column name. 

Getting the data preparation phase right is the key to creating powerful visualizations. 

Recall the center coordinates that were defined with `astropy` `SkyCoord`.
Get the central RA and Dec as values (datatype float) and print them.


```python
center_ra = center_coords.ra.deg
center_dec = center_coords.dec.deg
print(center_ra, center_dec)
```

Create a python dictionary that associates the `r_extendedness` column with the Object being a star or a galaxy.


```python
object_map = {0.0: 'star', 1.0: 'galaxy'}
```

Create a python dictionary to store the data from the query and pass to the `ColumnDataSource`.
All columns in a CDS must have the same length.


```python
data = dict(ra=results['ra'], dec=results['dec'],
            target_ra=results['ra']-center_ra,
            target_dec=results['dec']-center_dec,
            gmi=results['mag_g_cModel']-results['mag_i_cModel'],
            gmag=results['mag_g_cModel'],
            rmag=results['mag_r_cModel'],
            imag=results['mag_i_cModel'])
source = ColumnDataSource(data=data)
```

Additional data can be added to the CDS after creation, as
demonstrated in the cell below with the addition of `objectId` and `extendedness` in the r-band.

Note that the `objectId` needs to be converted to a string, 
because bokeh can't interpret an integer value that high.


```python
objIdString = np.array(results['objectId']).astype('str')
source.data['objectId'] = objIdString
source.data['r_extendedness'] = results['r_extendedness']
```

Use the `object_map` dictionary to add an `object_type` column to the CDS.


```python
source.data['object_type'] = results['r_extendedness'].map(object_map)
source.data['object_type']
```

### 5.3. Plot a color-magnitude diagram

Use bokeh to plot a color-magnitude (g vs. g-i) diagram making use of the `cModel` magnitudes.
Hover over the points in the plot to see their values.

Define the plot aesthetics and tools.


```python
plot_options = {'height': 400, 'width': 400,
                'tools': ['box_select', 'reset', 'box_zoom', 'help']}
```

Define the hover tool.


```python
tooltips = [
    ("Col (g-i)", "@gmi"),
    ("Mag (g)", "@gmag"),
    ("Mag (r)", "@rmag"),
    ("Mag (i)", "@imag"),
    ("Type", "@object_type")
]
hover_tool_cmd = HoverTool(tooltips=tooltips)
```

Create a color-magnitude diagram.


```python
p = figure(title="Color - Magnitude Diagram",
           x_axis_label='g-i', y_axis_label='g',
           x_range=(-1.8, 4.3), y_range=(23.5, 16),
           **plot_options)
```

Color-code the different object types by defining a color map palette.


```python
object_type_palette = ['darkred', 'lightgrey']
p.add_tools(hover_tool_cmd)
p.scatter(x='gmi', y='gmag', source=source,
          size=3, alpha=0.6,
          legend_field="object_type",
          color=factor_cmap('object_type',
                            palette=object_type_palette,
                            factors=['star', 'galaxy']),
          hover_color="darkblue")
```

Show the interactive plot.


```python
show(p)
```

Figure 4: The $g-i$ color vs. the $g$-band apparent magnitude for galaxies (grey) and stars (maroon). The hover text includes the color, magnitudes, and type for each point.

### 5.4. Plot a color-color (r-i vs. g-r) diagram

Add a color-color (r-i vs. g-r) diagram and make use of the advanced linking features of bokeh 
to enable brushing and linking between the the color-magnitude diagram and this color-color plot.


```python
source.data['rmi'] = results['mag_r_cModel'] - results['mag_i_cModel']
source.data['gmr'] = results['mag_g_cModel'] - results['mag_r_cModel']
```

The CMD above is very crowded. Below, filter on object type and plot stars only.

Use a GroupFilter to select rows from the CDS that satisfy `object_type` = "star".


```python
stars = CDSView()
stars.filter = GroupFilter(column_name='object_type', group="star")
```

Define the various options for the plot, and create the hover tool.


```python
plot_options = {'height': 350, 'width': 350,
                'tools': ['box_zoom', 'box_select',
                          'lasso_select', 'reset', 'help']}

hover_tool = HoverTool(tooltips=[("(RA,DEC)", "(@ra, @dec)"),
                                 ("(g-r,g)", "(@gmr, @gmag)"),
                                 ("objectId", "@objectId"),
                                 ("type", "@object_type")])
```

Create the three plots: spatial, color-magnitude, and color-color, then plot all three together on a grid.

Create the spatial plot.


```python
title_spatial = 'Spatial centred on (RA,DEC) = '+use_center_coords

fig_spatial = figure(title=title_spatial,
                     x_axis_label="Delta RA", y_axis_label="Delta DEC",
                     **plot_options)
fig_spatial.scatter(x='target_ra', y='target_dec',
                    source=source, view=stars,
                    size=4.0, alpha=0.6,
                    color='teal', hover_color='firebrick')
fig_spatial.add_tools(hover_tool)
```

Create the color-magnitude plot.


```python
fig_cmag = figure(title="Color-Magnitude Diagram",
                  x_axis_label="g-r", y_axis_label="g",
                  x_range=(-1.0, 2.0), y_range=(23.5, 16),
                  **plot_options)
fig_cmag.scatter(x='gmr', y='gmag', source=source, view=stars,
                 size=4.0, alpha=0.6,
                 color='teal', hover_color='firebrick')
fig_cmag.add_tools(hover_tool)
```

Create the color-color plot.


```python
fig_cc = figure(title="Color-Color Diagram",
                x_axis_label="g-r", y_axis_label="r-i",
                x_range=(-1.0, 2.0), y_range=(-1.0, 2.5),
                **plot_options)
fig_cc.scatter(x='gmr', y='rmi', source=source, view=stars,
               size=4.0, alpha=0.6,
               color='teal', hover_color='firebrick')
fig_cc.add_tools(hover_tool)
```

Show all three plots together in a row.


```python
p = gridplot([[fig_spatial, fig_cmag, fig_cc]])
show(p)
```

Figure 5: Three side-by-side panels showing points for stars only (teal). Left: the difference in right ascension (Delta RA) vs. the difference in declination (Delta DEC) between object coordinates and 62, -37 degrees. Center: the $g-r$ color vs. the $g$-band apparent magnitude. Right: the $g-r$ color vs. the $r-i$ color. The hover text is the same for all panels: the coordinates, the $g-r$ color and $g$ mag, `objectId`, and type. 

Hover the mouse over the data points in any of the plots in order to 
use the hover tool to see information about individual data points (e.g., the `objectId`).
Notice the data points highlighted in red on one panel with the hover tool are also highlighted on the other panels.

Click on the box select or lasso select icons in the upper right corner of the figure. 
Use the box select or lasso select functionality to make a selection in any panel by clicking and dragging to define a region. 
The selected data points will be displayed in darker teal in all panels.

Use the refresh icon to reset the plot.

Clean up.


```python
del results, data, p, stars, source
```

## 6. Exercises for the learner

(1) In Section 3.3, use `WHERE ... BETWEEN ... AND ...` to create a query to retrieve
blue objects (instead of red) which have $g-r<0$ and $r-i<0$.
Hint: `r_cModelFlux BETWEEN i_cModelFlux AND g_cModelFlux`

(2) In Section 5.1, rewrite the query to use `WHERE ... BETWEEN ... AND ...` in order
to restrict the magnitudes of the rows returned. Use the demonstration in Section 2.4
to retrieve the $g-r$ and $r-i$ colors as part of the query, instead of creating
them in Section 5.4.

(3) The query below has three errors. Try running it, and see that the job fails with
phase ERROR. Use `job.raise_if_error()` to figure out what the three errors are.
This is the same three-table join query as was used in Section 4.2, just with 
three errors added.

```
SELECT scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(fs.psfFlux) AS mag, scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag(fs.psfFlux, fs.psfFluxErr) AS magerr, cv.band, cv.expMidptMJD FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object AS o JOIN dp02_dc2.catalogs.ForcedSource AS fs ON o.objectId = fs.objectId JOIN dp02_dc2_catalogs.CcdVisit AS cv ON fs.ccdVisitId = cv.visitId WHERE CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', o.coord_ra, o.coord_dec), CIRCLE('ICRS', 62.1479031, -35.799138, 0.0006)) = 1 AND o.detect_isPrimary = 1
```

(4) In Section 4.2, the light curve is not plotted because the same data was retrieved
as in Section 4.1.2. Go back and plot the data retrieved in Section 4.2, but this time
show all six LSST filters in the plot.


```python

```
