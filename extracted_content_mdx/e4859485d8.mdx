# rubin_sim

Scheduler, survey strategy analysis, and other simulation tools for Rubin Observatory.

  


## rubin_sim

The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is anticipated to encompass around 2 million observations spanning a decade, averaging 800 visits per night. The `rubin_sim` package was built to help understand the predicted performance of the LSST.

The `rubin_sim` package contains the following main modules:

  * `phot_utils` \- provides synthetic photometry using provided throughput curves based on current predicted performance.
  * `skybrightness` incorporates the ESO sky model, modified to match measured sky conditions at the LSST site, including an addition of a model for twilight skybrightness. This is used to generate the pre-calculated skybrightness data used in `rubin_scheduler.skybrightness_pre`.
  * `moving_objects` provides a way to generate synthetic observations of moving objects, based on how they would appear in pointing databases ("opsims") created by `rubin_scheduler`.
  * `maf` the Metrics Analysis Framework, enabling efficient and scientifically varied evaluation of the LSST survey strategy and progress by providing a framework to enable these metrics to run in a standardized way on opsim outputs.



More documentation for `rubin_sim` is available at https://rubin-sim.lsst.io, including installation instructions.

### Getting Help

Questions about `rubin_sim` can be posted on the sims slack channel, or on https://community.lsst.org/c/sci/survey_strategy/ (optionally, tag @yoachim and/or @ljones so we get notifications about it).
