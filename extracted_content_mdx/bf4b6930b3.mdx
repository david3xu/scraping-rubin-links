# nbreport

nbreport is a client for creating and publishing LSST's notebook-based reports. Notebook-based reports are generated from template repositories, computed, and published with LSST the Docs.

**Documentation:** https://nbreport.lsst.io

## Installation

nbreport is available on pypi.org:
    
    
    pip install nbreport
    

nbreport is made for Python 3.6 _and newer._

## Overview

You can use nbreport to:

  1. Create an _instance_ of a report from a report repository.
  2. Fill that instance in with template variables that configure the report instance.
  3. Compute the report instance.
  4. Publish the report instance.



Try this test command to get a sense for how nbreport work:
    
    
    nbreport test https://github.com/lsst-sqre/nbreport --git-subdir tests/TESTR-000 -c title "My first report"
    

This test command uses the TESTR-000 example report repository in this project's own Git repository. Next, it creates a new instance called `TESTR-000-test` in your current working directory and configures the notebook so that the `title` variable is `"My first report"`. Finally, the test command runs the notebook to generate outputs.
